        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I am a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. 
            I became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of my birth — a fate that caused 
            me to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout my childhood. 
            After joining Team Kakashi, I worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all 
            the while chasing my dream to become Hokage. </p>
        <p>In the following years, through many hardships 
            and ordeals, I became a capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon 
            after, the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. I proved to 
            be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading me to achieve 
            my dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage.</p>
