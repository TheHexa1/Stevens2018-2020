    <h1>Where did I get my training?</h1>
    <main>
        <h2>Initial training: Konoha Ninja Academy</h2>
        <p>Favourite class: Iruka sensei's class</p>
        <aside>Memorble event: <br/>
            Failing once again to graduate from the Academy, 
            a disappointed me was advised by one of my instructors, Mizuki, 
            to steal the Scroll of Seals and learn a technique from it in order to graduate. 
            As I struggled to learn the Shadow Clone Technique, Iruka Umino 
            tracked me down and realised that I was tricked by Mizuki into 
            stealing the scroll. Mizuki attacked us and told me about the 
            Nine-Tails sealed within me, claiming that Iruka hated me because of it. 
            When Iruka risked his life to protect me, however, I saw through 
            Mizuki's lies and used the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique to defeat him, 
            prompting Iruka to happily grant me my graduation from the Academy. &#128513;</aside>

        <h2>Second training: Under Master Jiraiya</h2>
        <p>Favourite place: Mount Byoku(Where sage toad lives)</p>
        <aside>Memorble event: <br/>
            Two years into our training, My control of the 
            Nine-Tails' chakra had improved significantly. Jiraiya tried to give me more 
            access to the Nine-Tails' power and uses Gerotora to weaken my 
            Eight Trigrams Sealing Style. Seizing the opportunity, the Nine-Tails mocked 
            me for my inability to save Sasuke, using my negative emotions to force 
            me to enter a version 2 form with four tails. Not in control of my body, I 
            attacked Jiraiya and nearly killed him before he manages to suppress the Nine-Tails. 
            I had no memory of what happened and Jiraiya told me afterwards. He also told me to 
            keep my anger in check so that the Nine-Tails won't flare up again. &#128552;</aside>

        <h2>Jinchuriki control training: Under Killer Bee (8 tail's Jinchuriki)</h2>
        <p>Favourite place: On the back of floating Turtle size of an island </p>
        <aside>Memorble event: <br/>
            While I was doing tug-of-war with nine tails to control its Chakra, 
            just before I was completely consumed, the spirit of my mother, Kushina Uzumaki, appeared. 
            I believed that Kushina was the Nine-Tails in disguise, earning a hit on the head and an 
            immediately apology from her, who hoped that I did not inherit her short-temper. 
            Realising Kushina was my mother, I tearfully hugged her and the love-filled reunion purged 
            the Nine-Tails' hatred within its drained chakra. With renewed confidence from hearing 
            the story of my parents, I battled the Nine-Tails once more. With my mother's assistance, 
            I successfully weakened the fox long enough to separate it from its chakra. Attaining the 
            Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, I imprisoned the emaciated and infuriated Nine-Tails within a new, 
            stronger seal, apologising to it as it faded into darkness. Afterwards, I learned from Kushina 
            about my heritage, the truth behind the Nine-Tails' attack on Konoha, and how my parents gave 
            their lives to protect me. I told my mother that I could finally understood what a parent's love 
            felt like and that I didn't blame them for what happened, instead feeling glad to be 
            their son. As she faded away, Kushina tearfully hugged Naruto, thanking him for letting 
            her and Minato be his parents. &#128543; &#128546; &#128557;</aside>
