1,06-May-19,"The mainstream media continues to aid the Democrat Party in their quest to destroy President Trump leading up to the 2020 election. Yesterday, ABC News published an article and then tweeted it to over 14 million followers on Twitter that talks about a “new effort” that’s been launched to “democratically elect the vice president in 2020.”There's a national push for voters to elect the U.S. vice president separately from the president. https://t.co/dOM0x7Lm1d— ABC News (@ABC) May 6, 2019The ABC News article begins by talking about a “national push” for “voters to elect the U.S. vice president separately from the president.”The ABC News article talks about Vice.run and its founder, David Blake who announced a national movement to elect the vice president independent of the votes cast for President of the United StatesTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Vice.run, is a campaign that seeks to create a separate and independent ballot line for the vice president in 2020. The group is trying to collect — from all 50 states — voter signatures and pledges in support of the separate vice president election.“An independently-elected vice president would give American voters a new level of direct control over who serves in the White House,” Vice.run says on its website. “Further, a separately-elected vice president could provide a moderating influence on the partisanship of the president.”The founder of Vice.run David Blake announced on Twitter earlier this month that Utah became the first state to reach the signature pledges goal since launching their website in March.ABC News even includes a video message from the Vice.run founder’s Twitter page. The only problem is the Vice.run Twitter account only has 236 followers.It’s kind of hard to start a national movement that changes the way America votes before the 2020 election when you’re only reaching 236 people on Twitter.You did it, Utah! Thanks to your efforts, we now have our first state with enough pledges to get ballot access for an independently elected Vice President. #electthevp pic.twitter.com/L5RNed6ncQ— vice.run (@ElectTheVP) May 3, 2019Vice.run tweets about the success they’ve had in a state that elected Mitt Romney as their United States Senator. Romney, who lost the 2012 presidential election to Barack Obama, is one of President Trump’s most vocal opponents. This feels more like a piece that ABC News is running to stir up a movement than to report about a movement, in our opinion.We are taking this effort all the way, and people are taking notice.

2,06-May-19,"There are already plenty of unforced errors coming from the appearances of 2020 candidate Joe Biden last weekend, but this one takes the cake.In an effort to try and gain sympathy and to have a hands-off approach from the press, Biden told a crowd at a fundraiser that his adult granddaughter said, “Mommy and daddy had a divorce and they’re going to really go after that.”He shamelessly made ridiculous claims that President Trump will go after his family during the campaign.In fact, he even claimed his grown-up granddaughter told him that the fact that “mommy and daddy had a divorce” would be exploited in the 2020 campaign.“This guy is going to go after me and my family. My generic point is they know how tough it’s going to be.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Was this a warning to the media and other candidates?The Washington Examiner reports that  Biden, 76, spoke about how one of his grandsons, Robert “Hunter” Biden II, 13, said “Pop, you have to run pop,” at a family meeting eight weeks ago. He also said how Hunter Jr. showed him a photo circulating on the internet from the funeral of his father Beau — who died in 2015 aged 46 — and said, “Pop, it says: ‘Look at Biden molesting a kid.'”The former vice president said one grandchild told him: “Pop, I know it’s going to be mean, they’re going to say bad things about daddy. Mommy and daddy had a divorce and they’re going to really go after that.”That appeared to be a quotation from one of Hunter Biden’s children. He has three daughters, Naomi, 24, Finnegan, 19, and Maisy, 18.Adult grandchildren of Joe Biden speak like this?There is plenty of baggage to report on Joe Biden without resorting to attacking his family. Of all people, President Trump knows what it’s like to be attacked and to have his family in the spotlight being attacked.This tactic is all part of Biden’s shtick and attempts at playing coy with the media. Let’s face it, he doesn’t want the hard questions about his inappropriate touching of women and is using his grandchildren to fend off any criticism.HE PANDERED ALL WEEKEND IN SOUTH CAROLINA TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY:One thing is true…Joe Biden panders and lies during campaign speeches like no one else. He’s had decades to perfect his technique of trying to raise fear in the minority community to keep those votes coming. The question is…are the people in the black community still buying Biden’s shtick?Joe Biden took a page from the Hillary Clinton playbook yesterday when during a rally in Columbia, South Carolina he pandered to the black vote by telling the “folks” that racism and hatred by Republicans and  Trump will bring back “Jim Crow” laws:“Folks, last year, 24 states introduced or enacted at least 70 bills to curtail the right the vote. And guess what, mostly directed at ‘people of color’ You see it. We have Jim Crow sneaking back in. No, I mean it!”He pointed out the Stacey Abrams loss and the Florida race where Andrew Gillum lost his race for governor.“Why? Because they know if everybody has an equal right to vote, guess what? They lose!” Biden brought up the 2015 Charleston church shooting and Obama singing ‘Amazing Grace’:“I watched my buddy Barack stand up there, I watched him talk, and he talked about we have to find that ‘Amazing Grace’. What we’ve never seen, when we have bad folks splitting people…Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, marching, chanting hate coming out of the woods literally with their torches, coming out from under rocks, and shouting the same antisemitic bile that was shouted and spoken to in Germany in the 30’s.”Biden gave a glowing description of Obama, of course, and kept calling him his “buddy”:“By the way, he’s a hell of a guy, I worked with him for eight years, I watched him, he has enormous integrity, and nobody I’ve ever worked with was smarter, and he is a decent, decent, decent man,” Biden said. “And folks, I think he was one of the best president’s we’ve ever, ever had.”Must be 50 people there.

3,05-May-19,"Former Vice President Joe Biden will be 78-years-old by the time the election rolls around in November of 2020 so it’s no wonder he gets a little mixed up sometimes. The problem is that this isn’t just some family friend or elderly Uncle Joe. This man is running for president!He told a group of donors in Columbia, South Carolina on Saturday that “14 heads of state” have contacted him, and “voiced concerns about Trump.” The problem with that is that Bloomberg reports he included Margaret Thatcher in his list of leaders. Did she contact him from the grave? Not only is this really bad form for a former VP but even worse for someone who is trying to be taken seriously in the 2020 election. Would this comment of faux concern have a tinge of sedition in it?He did correct himself claiming he was actually referring to British Prime Minister Theresa May but the gaffe is out there and is just one more example of Biden’s scattered thinking on the stump (see below).Biden also went low and called President Trump a  “clown” and a  “no good S.O.B.”While Biden claims to be taking the high road when he compares himself to President Trump, it certainly is a low blow to speak of a sitting president like Biden continues to do.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]He also pulled out the race card during his South Carolina visit saying that Republicans want to take us back to “Jim Crow”.The supercut below shows just how scattered Joe really is when he mixes up words and even makes up new ones during his speech to Union workers.The curious thing is that not one of the many gaffes below was seen on the news.Biden really nailed it today.

4,05-May-19,"The Democrats are in trouble, and they know it. President Trump’s economy is now considered the “envy of the world,” and his new U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr has made no secret about the DOJ’s investigation into those who spied on Donald Trump and the Trump campaign in 2016. Both of these developments spell very bad news for Democrats and their chances of defeating President Trump in the 2020 general election.Democrats, who for decades have been trying to convince Americans that they are the party of diversity, have put up enough presidential candidates to fill a ballroom. Unfortunately, for the party of division and deceit, it looks like they’re going to end up with a choice of two candidates. The two frontrunners include Senator Bernie Sanders, an aging, white, male, who’s an avowed socialist that became a millionaire after years of working as a public servant, and former VP Joe Biden, the other aging, white, male, who earned the nickname “Creepy Joe” for his inability to keep his hands and lips off the bodies, heads and necks of young girls and random women.The Chicago Tribune just published an exhaustive list of Democrats who hope to unseat President Trump in 2020.Officially in: Colorado Sen.

6,05-May-19,"The Clintons are desperate for every dollar they can grift from their loyalists, so they planned a pity party road show. Since the Clinton Foundation dollars dried up, this is their last ditch effort to profit off of the people who are still clinging to their “I’m With Her” dreams…Well, it looks like that road show hit a speed bump!Ticket prices have plummeted for the Clinton grifters!Tickets were going for as low as $20 for their 13-city pity party tour.Stub Hub tickets were even lower than that!Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]According to the New York Post, prices have dropped from $1,785 in November to a price that is now less than half of that: The best seats in the house at Seattle’s WaMu Theater on Friday could be had for $829, a steep 54% drop from the $1,785 that the former first couple fetched when the tour was announced in early November.Groupon was used to try and push tickets to the tour and prices for the 90-minute “performance” on Friday were from $66.50 to $519.The sour grapes and fearmongering continued with Hillary claiming:“I really believe that we are in a crisis, a constitutional crisis. This is a test for our country.”Bill jumped in with this gem of a lie about the Trump administration:“These people, they don’t believe the same set of rules apply to them that apply to everyone else.”Projection much?The ironic thing is that the tour was produced by Live Nation…the company that also produced Michelle Obama’s tour. When the tour was announced last Fall, Live Nation said the Clintons would discuss “stories and inspiring anecdotes that shaped their historic careers in public service, while also discussing issues of the day and looking toward the future.”It looks like the American people are 100% FED Up! with the Clinton grifters… ",fake

Abrams justified her refusal to accept the result of the election by calling Kemp “an architect of voter suppression that spent the last eight years knitting together a system of voter suppression that is unparalleled in America.”According to Texas Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek, she said in her remarks that “we don’t have to concede elections anymore, because when we concede, we are condoning systems that are used to oppress us.”ABRAMS IS UNDER INVESTIGATION IN GEORGIA FOR ETHICS VIOLATIONS RELATED TO THE 2018 ELECTION FOR GOVERNOR:Georgia’s new director of the state ethics commission started his job on Monday and wasted no time getting down to business.Former county prosecutor David Emadi plans to subpoena bank records from the campaign of 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and groups that raised money for her.Abrams’ campaign manager wasted no time in calling Emadi biased:“The new ethics chief…a Kemp donor and former Republican Party leader…is using his power to threaten and lob baseless partisan accusations at the former Abrams campaign when they should be focused on real problems like the unethical ties between the governor’s office and voting machine lobbyists instead.”After Emadi was introduced to the media as the new ethics commission director, he discussed that the investigation into the Abrams campaign is “moving forward”:“Those investigations are all moving forward. What I can say about the investigation into the Abrams campaign is, in the relatively near future, I expect we will be issuing subpoenas for bank and finance records of both Miss Abrams and various PACs and special-interest groups that were affiliated with her campaign.”The investigations began after an audit of Abram’s campaign:AJC reports:More than a dozen “independent groups,” mostly funded by out-of-state donors, were created in Georgia last year to help support Abrams’ effort. Abrams still hasn’t conceded to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp but has been touted as a possible candidate for U.S. Senate, President, Vice-President and a 2022 run for Governor of Georgia…Emadi means business and has vowed to be neutral and stick to the facts.He even vowed not to vote during his tenure.THIS IS IRONIC:Stacey Abrams has a bad case of delusion caused by sour grapes…During a speech to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, Abrams delivered the unbelievable claim that “We won”.She goes on to explain why she still hasn’t conceded.“We had this little election back in 2018.

Did Abrams go to the Hillary Clinton School of Election Loss Denial? It’s all about Stacey and keeping her name out there. She joined Jake Tapper to make claims that are just not true. Why give this woman a platform to divide but…THIS IS CNN.“The law, as it stands, says that he received an adequate number of votes to become the governor of Georgia, and I acknowledge the law as it stands. I am a lawyer by training and I am someone who’s taken a Constitutional oath to uphold the law, but we know sometimes the law does not do what it should and something being legal does not make it right. This is someone who has compromised our systems. He has compromised our Democratic systems and that is not appropriate.”Something tells us Abrams won’t fade away but will continue to be a divisive politician. Maybe that’s why she lost.Notice how Tapper questions Abrams on whether she considers the election of Kemp “legitimate”…“He is the legal governor of Georgia and here’s the thing, Jake. I want to be very clear. Words have meaning and I’ve spent my lifetime not only as an attorney. but as a writer and I’m careful of the words I choose. When he takes the oath of office he will be the legal governor of the state of Georgia, the legal victor, but what you are looking to me to say is that there was no compromise of our democracy and that there should be some political compromise in the language I use and that’s not right. What’s not right is saying that something was done properly when it was not.”She continued…“I will never deny the legal premature that says he is in this position and I pray for his success, but will I say that this election was not tainted, was not a disinvestment and disenfranchisement of thousands of voters?

9,04-May-19,"The liberal media is in a full-blown panic over the prospect of losing any chance they had of defeating President Trump in 2020. The U.S. economy, as stated by the Drudge Report yesterday, is the “envy of the world.” Unemployment for Blacks, Hispanics, and women is at an all-time low, and Americans are seeing more money in their pockets as a result of the Trump tax cuts. But what’s really got the media down, is U.S. Attorney General Barr’s “no collusion” and “no obstruction of justice” conclusions on the Mueller report, that was predicated by a spying operation on President Trump and his 2016 campaign.Yesterday, a very angry Democrat U.S. Representative, Jamie Raskin (MD), took part in a four-person panel with MSNBC’s Yasmin Vossoughian. Rep Raskin joined the chorus of Democrats who are desperately trying to discredit AG Barr, who promised there would be an investigation by the DOJ into how the investigation was initiated on President Trump and his campaign, while he was still a private citizen.  Raskin told the MSNBC host that “What we have is an administration that is now engulfed in lawlessness and corruption,” saying that Democrats in Congress needs to “check them.” Raskin stated that the Attorney General should be on “our side,” claiming, “He’s obviously gone over to the side of the President and is cooperating in promoting the President’s position, now, which is that he will not cooperate with any subpoenas, he will not respond to any lawful order or requests from the House of Representatives.”Raskin was referring to AG Barr’s decision to decline his invitation to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee about the Meuller report, after the committee, under the direction of  Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) decided to allow staff members to question AG Barr during the Congressional hearings. Barr responded to their decision by saying that if staff members wanted to question him in a congressional hearing, they should run for a seat in Congress.A frustrated Rep Raskin boldly, and without any evidence, claimed Barr’s behavior is “constitutionally intolerable,” saying “Congress can’t put up with it.” Raskin explained, “We have to make clear to the public and to the whole system of government that the attorney general is acting outside of the law.”The MSNBC host overplayed her hand when she asked the Democrat congressman how the media could work with the Democrats to destroy the credibility of our U.S. Attorney General. Three times, Yasmin Vossoughian used the word “we” to when she openly strategized with her Democrat lawmaker guest, saying:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“You’re bringing up a really good point here. Because one of the, I think, directives here, and the big question here is—do we pursue the Attorney General until he provides testimony for the House? Or, do we pursue the unredacted Mueller report along with testimony from Bob Mueller? Is that where we put our energy?”Watch” What do you think about this exchange?

Ilhan Omar who has become known for her anti-American and anti-Israel comments. She was an activist in her Somali Muslim community in 2013 when the video was recorded.In the recently discovered video from 2013, Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar is seen joking about Americans saying “Al Qaeda” and “Hezbollah” in a troubled voice.She goes on to say that no one says words like “America” that way.“When I was in college, I took a terrorism class. … The thing that was interesting in the class was every time the professor said ‘Al Qaeda’ his shoulders went up,”… “Al Qaeda” and “Hezbollah.”“But you know, it is that you don’t say ‘America’ with an intensity, you don’t say ‘England’ with the intensity. You don’t say ‘the army’ with the intensity… But you say these names because you want that word to carry weight. You want it to be something.”A recently discovered video shows @IlhanMN mocking Americans for their anxiety about al-Qaeda, equating US armed forces to al-Qaeda and Hezbollah. pic.twitter.com/VBuKhAHjjE— The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) April 11, 2019It’s beyond troubling that there is someone in our government who is mocking Americans for being fearful of terrorist groups.The Somali refugee was an activist in her community when she mocked Americans.It’s pretty unbelievable that Omar is mocking the very people who rescued her from the refugee camp she was supposedly suffering under.The number of Muslim registered voters is up 324,000 since the last Presidential election. As our State Department continues to seed small and large communities across America, expect to see more and more of these results. Speaking of America, does anyone see an American flag anywhere in the room during Ilhan Omar’s acceptance speech in her native language? Does the idea of Sharia Law still seem like a far-fetched idea in America? Political jobs held by two veteran Democratic politicians have been outsourced to two young immigrants, underscoring the growing impact of mass immigration on white-collar Americans.
The two Democrats who have lost their jobs to immigrants are both experienced, established and liberal members of the state’s version of the Democratic party: 22-term Rep. Phyllis Kahn and 10-term Rep. Joe Mullery, both from Minneapolis.They were beaten in state primaries on August 9 by two political newcomers: Somali-born, hijab-wearing Ilhan Omar and Thailand-born Hmong immigrant, Fue Lee. The primaries were arranged by the state’s Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party.Ilhan Omar’s website attributed her win to immigrant Somalis: “More than 250 volunteers and 450 individual donors supported Ilhan’s campaign. ‘I am so proud that the majority of contributions to my campaign are from members of the Somali community who believe in my leadership,’” the site said. Somalis in other states supported her, including Washington state and Ohio.Kahn was actually beaten by two Somalis–Omar and Mohamud Noor. She had only 1,726 votes to Omar’s 2,404 votes. The second Somali candidate, Noor, edged Kahn with 1,738 votes. Compared to 2014, primary turnout rose by almost 40 percent in the 60B district, which includes most of the University of Minnesota.",fake
11,03-May-19,"Last month, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), the first female Somali Muslim immigrant to be elected in Minnesota’s State legislature, sat down for an interview with KARE 11’s Jana Shortal. During their conversation, Omar was asked about her controversial comments she made at a recent CAIR event in Los Angeles, where she complained about how Muslims were turned into victims after the horrendous attack that killed almost 3,000 Americans on 9-11 by Islamic terrorists.After Omar told Shortal that she thought “regret is a strange word,” when asked about her anti-Semitic remarks, Omar was asked about her controversial 9-11 remarks. Shortal asked Omar if she understood how Americans might be upset by her calling Islamic terrorists on 9-11, “some people” who “did something”? Shortal explained, “Some people are offended by those four words. They suggest that you were not describing that day accurately, as they were just some people. What would you say to that?” Instead of apologizing for the words she used to describe the 9-11 terror attack, Omar relied on her victim status,  saying, “I think that there is particular bias and a particular lens that people sort of um, critique the words I use. And that is not a bias or a lens that I can get rid of with one answer or one conversation.”U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) is not the only Muslim lawmaker who considers herself and her fellow Muslims in America to be “victims” after 9-11. U.S.Representative Rashida Tlaib, the pro-Palestine Democrat from Michigan recently expressed how she too, has felt like a victim living in America since 9-11.Now, the Somali Muslim immigrant turned MN state lawmaker, Hodan Hassan has joined the victim chorus with Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, as she told an interviewer that 9-11 was the cause of “Islamophobia” in America. Hassan described how since 9-11, she has felt victimized by Americans.The Minnesota lawmaker recalled the events of 9-11, and claimed that the terror attack on Americans by Islamic terrorists was the start of “Islamophobia” in America, calling it “problematic for people who live in this country.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Every day since 9-11, Hassan claims her life has “changed her view of America.” The Minnesota Muslim lawmaker claimed that it’s been” eye-opening.” Hassan cites examples she sees every day on TV of “a problem in a Muslim country,” or “a Muslim person that has been targeted because of Islamophobia.”“Anybody can pick on you when you’re at the airport because your last name is Mohammed or Hassan. Uh…lucky me, my last name is Hassan,” the Minnesota state representative told the interviewer, as she sarcastically laughed.Hassan reveals that “luckily” she doesn’t have to worry about being targeted in Minnesota, because “there’s a very large Muslim community in Minnesota.”Watch:Minnesota has been Conquered!Meet Hodan Hassan the newly elected Democratic member of the MN House of Rep, representing District 62AHassan is the 2nd Somali female, after Ilhan Omar, to be elected to the state legislatureHassan describes how Muslims are the victims of 9/11 pic.twitter.com/f7VlDuOq2W— Amy Mek (@AmyMek) March 12, 2019Hassan’s district is heavily populated with Somali refugees.

12,03-May-19,"Kirsten Gillibrand’s presidential campaign is a total dud. She has yet to even break 1 percent in the polls. Now she’s advancing a stupid idea to stay in the news cycle.She wants to give Americans “Democracy Dollars” which they could use to donate to political campaigns.
NBC News reports:‘Democracy Dollars’: Gillibrand’s plan to give every voter $600 to donate to campaignsSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., unveiled a plan on Wednesday to give every voter up to $600 in what she calls “Democracy Dollars” that they can donate to federal candidates for office.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]In an exclusive interview with NBC News to discuss the roll out of her first major 2020 policy initiative, Gillibrand said her “Clean Elections Plan” would help reduce the influence of big money in politics.“If you want to accomplish anything that the American people want us to accomplish — whether it’s healthcare as a right, better public schools, better economy — you have to take on the greed and corruption that determine everything in Washington,” she said.Under Gillibrand’s plan, every eligible voter could register for vouchers to donate up to $100 in a primary election and $100 in a general election each cycle, either all at once or in $10 increments to one or more candidates over time. Each participant would get a separate $200 pool for House, Senate and presidential contests for a total maximum donation of $600 for those federal offices.So the government takes money from taxpayers, then gives it back to them so they can give it back to politicians? That makes no sense. It could also make things worse.The Washington Examiner reports:Hate campaign spending? Gillibrand’s ‘democracy dollars’ would put it on steroidsPresidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., has a new plan to tackle money in politics: Create a subsidy for political candidates so lavish that they can raise “exponentially higher” amounts.Dumping billions of tax dollars into partisan political campaigns is a proposal only a politician could love. Yet it underscores an ugly reality of efforts to improve campaigns. Politicians aren’t interested in reforms that make it harder for them to be a politician.Instead, Gillibrand proposes a program to give every voter up to $600 in government money each election cycle. The vouchers could be contributed in increments as small as $10 to candidates for the House, Senate, and the presidency.
These seemingly modest amounts could add up fast and dwarf current campaign spending.This is nothing more than a stunt by a flailing campaign.Gillibrand is going nowhere fast.",fake
13,03-May-19,"The Wall Street Journal reports – Mr. Barr tolerantly sat through hours of Democratic insults at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday. His reward for his patience was to be labeled, in the space of a news cycle, a lawbreaking, dishonest, obstructing hack. Speaker Nancy Pelosi publicly accused Mr. Barr of lying to Congress, which, she added, is “considered a crime.”House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said he will move to hold Mr. Barr in contempt unless the attorney general acquiesces to the unprecedented demand that he submit to cross-examination by committee staff attorneys.A visibly shaking Democrat Rep. Steve Cohen (TN), pulled an embarrassing stunt yesterday when he held a rubber chicken up for the cameras, accusing AG Barr of being a “chicken,” while Democrat Rep. Ted Lieu shamelessly stood behind him. AG Barr refused to attend a House Judiciary Committee hearing over objections to a decision by Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) to include House staffers in the questioning of AG Barr during the congressional hearing.After munching on KFC, Cohen gesticulates with a toy poultry quipping that ""chicken Barr"" should have attended the hearing pic.twitter.com/guk83MGJbUTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]— TPM Livewire (@TPMLiveWire) May 2, 2019James Comey, former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, lamented that Donald Trump had “eaten” Mr. Barr’s “soul.” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren demands the attorney general resign. California Rep. Eric Swalwell wants him impeached.During AG Barr’s testimony, the disgraced, fired FBI director, James Comey immediately tweeted his perfectly time op-ed in the New York TimesWriting this brought me no joy. I’m sad for our country. https://t.co/zfKjdGAMp8 via @NYTOpinion— James Comey (@Comey) May 1, 2019The radical Democrat Senator from Hawaii, Mazie Hirono repeated the line that Attorney General Barr “lied,” demanding he resigns. Every time that AG Barr would try to answer Senator Hirono’s questions with facts, she would cut him off and demand he answer questions about the President’s morality. Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, finally cut off the angry Hirono, reminding her that she was allowed five minutes to question the AG Barr, not to “slander” him. These attacks aren’t about special counsel Robert Mueller, his report or even the surreal debate over Mr. Barr’s first letter describing the report. The attorney general delivered the transparency Democrats demanded: He quickly released a lightly redacted report, which portrayed the president in a negative light. What do Democrats have to object to?Some of this is frustration. Democrats foolishly invested two years of political capital in the idea that Mr. Mueller would prove President Trump had colluded with Russia, and Mr. Mueller left them empty-handed. Some of it is personal. Democrats resent that Mr. Barr won’t cower or apologize for doing his job. Some is bitterness that Mr. Barr is performing like a real attorney general, making the call against obstruction-of-justice charges rather than sitting back and letting Democrats have their fun with Mr. Mueller’s obstruction innuendo.But most of it is likely fear. Mr. Barr made real news in that Senate hearing, and while the press didn’t notice, Democrats did. The attorney general said he’d already assigned people at the Justice Department to assist his investigation of the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. He said his review would be far-reaching—that he was obtaining details from congressional investigations, from the ongoing probe by the department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, and even from Mr. Mueller’s work. Mr. Barr said the investigation wouldn’t focus only on the fall 2016 justifications for secret surveillance warrants against Trump team members but would go back months earlier.He also said he’d focus on the infamous “dossier” concocted by opposition-research firm Fusion GPS and British former spy Christopher Steele, on which the FBI relied so heavily in its probe. Mr. Barr acknowledged his concern that the dossier itself could be Russian disinformation, a possibility he described as not “entirely speculative.” He also revealed that the department has “multiple criminal leak investigations under way” into the disclosure of classified details about the Trump-Russia investigation.Do not underestimate how many powerful people in Washington have something to lose from Mr. Barr’s probe. Among them: Former and current leaders of the law-enforcement and intelligence communities. The Democratic Party pooh-bahs who paid a foreign national (Mr. Steele) to collect information from Russians and deliver it to the FBI. The government officials who misused their positions to target a presidential campaign. The leakers. The media. More than reputations are at risk. Revelations could lead to lawsuits, formal disciplinary actions, lost jobs, even criminal prosecution.The attacks on Mr. Barr are first and foremost an effort to force him out, to prevent this information from coming to light until Democrats can retake the White House in 2020. As a fallback, the coordinated campaign works as a pre-emptive smear, diminishing the credibility of his ultimate findings by priming the public to view him as a partisan.That’s why Mr. Barr isn’t alone in getting slimed. Natasha Bertrand at Politico last month penned a hit piece on the respected Mr. Horowitz. It’s clear the inspector general is asking the right questions. The Politico article acknowledges he’s homing in on Mr. Steele’s “credibility” and the dossier’s “veracity”—then goes on to provide a defense of Mr. Steele and his dossier, while quoting unnamed sources who deride the “quality” of the Horowitz probe, and (hilariously) claim the long-tenured inspector general is not “well-versed” in core Justice Department functions“We have to stop using the criminal justice process as a political weapon,” Mr. Barr said Wednesday. The line didn’t get much notice, but that worthy goal increasingly looks to be a reason Mr. Barr accepted this unpleasant job. Stopping this abuse requires understanding how it started. The liberal establishment, including journalists friendly with it, doesn’t want that to happen, and so has made it a mission to destroy Mr. Barr. The attorney general seems to know what he’s up against and remains undeterred. That’s the sort of steely will necessary to right the ship at the Justice Department and the FBI.Fox News’ Jesse Waters and Greg Gutfield brilliantly laid out why AG Barr has become the new target of the Democrat leadership and select members of the intelligence community. *The comments we added to the Wall Street Journal can be found in italics. ",fake

But key information, including its author’s anti-Trump bias and Democratic benefactors, was left out.Republicans have often cited the use of the dossier as misinformation used to improperly monitor Trump and his campaign during the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election while Democrats argued in a rebuttal memo that the FISA process was not abused and the Justice Department and FBI “met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA’s probable cause requirement.” Earlier this year, Nunes called on the FISA court to hold the FBI accountable for misleading them about the dossier, arguing that not doing so would do further damage to the credibility of the FISA process.MacCallum asked Rep.

17,02-May-19,"Yesterday was a very bad day for the Democrats. The testimony of Attorney General Barr in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee didn’t provide the results the Democrats were hoping for. Instead of providing evidence of President Trump committing obstruction of justice, the mean-spirited Democrats reminded American voter of that ugly time when they attempted to publicly flog Justice Bret Kavanaugh over an unsubstantiated and unproven 30+-year-old sexual misconduct charge.Immediately following the disappointing results of the Senate’s AG Barr witch hunt, House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler used his position as chair to publicly threaten AG Barr if he refused to appear before their committee, saying they would hold him in contempt.Nadler, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said during a radio interview yesterday that if “someone is in contempt of Congress, you send the Sergeant at Arms and you arrest them” or “you fine him $20,000 a day.” The New York Democrat has issued subpoenas for administration officials and is seeking documents related to Trump’s financial records and the Mueller report – but the president is refusing to play along.As promised, AG Barr did not show up for today’s scheduled hearing with the House Judiciary Committee.

Rep. Collins blasted their efforts, saying, “If staff members want to ask questions of AG Barr, they should run for Congress.” Collins exposed Nadler, and the Democrat lawmakers scheme, saying the only reason they wanted staffers to question AG Barr was to make it look like “impeachment hearings,” calling Nadler’s efforts a “circus political stunt.”Collins blasted Democrats saying, that the only reason he is not there, is because of Nadler’s stunt, where he wanted staff members of Congress to ask questions of AG Bill Barr.Rep.

When you call things dilatory, questioning the motives of what members are doing it for.”I have sat on this committee for six years, and I have sat through hours of motions to strike the last word, of giving other members on the minority side more time…more time. One of my biggest concerns I ever had with Chairman Goodlatte is, ‘Why do you let it continue? Just call the previous question!’ And on two occasions the last Congress, he did—after almost six to seven hours of debate.The question I have here, is not what Bill Barr is scared of, it’s what are the Democrats are scared of? They don’t want Bill Barr here today. They’ve had the report. They’be read it. They don’t like what’s in it. The Chairman won’t even go look at what the Attorney General offered him. It’s pretty amazing to me that he wants to go in executive session with it, but he won’t even go read it.”Rep. Collins went back to what happened yesterday when Nadler refused to allow Republicans to voice their objections. Collins directly confronted Chairman Nadler, saying disallowing the minority to speak will not continue.Watch:Over the 206-year history of this committee, staff have never questioned witnesses in an oversight hearing.

19,01-May-19,"NPR reports – In what would likely become the most restrictive abortion ban in the country, the Alabama House Tuesday passed a bill that would make it a crime for doctors to perform abortions at any stage of a pregnancy unless a woman’s life is threatened. The legislation is part of a broader anti-abortion strategy to prompt the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider the right to abortion.Republican state Rep. Terri Collins of Decatur, Ala. defended her “Human Life Protection Act” during, at times, contentious debate on the House floor.“This bill is focused on that baby that’s in the womb that is a person,” Collins said. “That baby, I believe, would choose life.”Democratic lawmakers walked out in protest before the final 74 to 3 vote. During the debate, they questioned the motive for an abortion ban in a state that’s refused to expand Medicaid. “I do support life, but there are some people that just support birth they don’t support life,” said Democratic Rep. Merika Coleman of Birmingham, Ala. “Because after a child is born there are some things that need to happen. We need to make sure that child has adequate health care,” Coleman said.The Daily Signal reports – If signed into law, House Bill 527 would also prohibit the Alabama Department of Public Health from renewing or granting a license to an abortion facility within 2,000 feet of a public school.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The legislation was modeled after laws that prevent convicted sex offenders from residing within 2,000 feet of a school.If passed, the legislation would force the Alabama Women’s Center for Reproductive Alternatives in Huntsville to close or relocate when its current license expires, due to its proximity to Edward White Middle School.Yesterday, during the abortion debate with Alabama legislators, Democrat State Rep. John Rogers, made an incredible statement to his fellow lawmakers. Rogers used the logic that black kids are gonna die anyhow, so what’s the use of letting them be born in the first place. He literally told them, “Some kids are unwanted, so you kill them now or you kill them later. You bring them in the world unwanted, unloved, you send them to the electric chair.

20,01-May-19," Cruz was the final Senator to question AG Barr, during the Senate Intelligence Committee hearings today. After Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), thanked U.S. Attorney General Barr for appearing before the committee where he would receive the “Kavanaugh treatment.” Cruz remarked about how the hearing today “has been quite revealing.” The Senator reminded everyone that one word the committee didn’t hear much of today was, “Russia.”“For two-and-a-half years, we heard Democrat Senators going on and on and on about Russian collusion. We heard journalists going on and on and on about Russian collusion, alleging among other things, some using extreme rhetoric, calling the President a ‘traitor'” Senator Cruz exclaimed.The outspoken Texas Senator reminded AG Barr and everyone on the committee,”We have heard very little of that today,” explaining that Democrats have abandoned the Russian collusion scheme, for an attack on AG Barr over a March 27th letter from special counsel Robert Mueller. Cruz said the American people need to understand the truth about their accusations against Mueller.Cruz laughed, saying, “If this is their whole argument—they ain’t got nothin’.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The Senator explained that when Attorney General Barr received the Mueller report, he released his 4-page summary of the conclusions to Congress and to the public. On March 27th, Mr. Mueller asked Barr to release the additional 19 pages of the introduction and summary that Mueller prepared. Cruz read Mueller’s request aloud, “I am requesting that you provide these materials to Congress, and authorize their public release at this time.” Cruz explained, “The reason he said that, is that to fully capture the context, nature, and substance and the office’s work and conclusion. Cruz continued,  “So you did not release those 19 pages at that time, instead, a couple of weeks later, you released 448 pages—the entire report, which includes those 19 pages. Do I have that timeline right?” he asked Attorney General Barr. “That’s right,” Barr responded.Cruz, sarcastically continued with his explanation of events, saying, “So their argument is—General Barr—you suppressed the 19 pages that are entirely public, that we have, that we can read, that they know every word of it. And their complaint is that it was delayed a couple of weeks.” Cruz concluded his assessment of the Democrats complaint, reminding everyone that Barr made that decision to wait before releasing the documents “piecemeal” so he could instead, release the entire 448 page Mueller report all at once.Finally, Senator Cruz told AG Barr, “If that is their argument, I have to say, that is an exceptionally weak argument.”Attorney General Barr, who just spent his entire day being berated, bullied and unfairly accused by angry Democrat Senators, surprised everyone when he busted out laughing at Senator Cruz’s brilliant breakdown of the manufactured accusations by a desperate group of politicians, who feared Trump would win the election in 2016, and fear he will win again in 2020.Watch:Watch the latest video at <a href=”https://www.foxnews.com”>foxnews.com</a>",fake

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and 2020 Democrat presidential candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, remain tight-lipped about the unimaginable horrors experienced by Venezuela’s victims of socialism.Only five years ago, Democratic presidential 2020 candidate, Bernie Sanders heralded Socialist-ruled Venezuela as an example of what the American dream should look like.In his essay, Bernie Sanders suggested the American dream” is more likely to be found in South America, using Venezuela as an example of a Socialist utopia. In his “Close The Gaps: Disparities That Threaten America” essay, the Socialist US Senator declared: “These days, the American dream is more apt to be realized in South America, in places such as Ecuador, Venezuela, and Argentina, where incomes are actually more equal today than they are in the land of Horatio Alger.”Sanders is currently polling at the top of the massive field of 2020 Democrat presidetial candidates.Today, on the streets of the socialist utopia of Venezuela, and an armored vehicle was caught on camera, as it drove into a large crowd of civilian supporters of opposition leader Juan Guaido on the street.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]***WARNING***video is graphic.Venezuela's socialist government just drove an armored vehicle into a crowd of civilianspic.twitter.com/m76yRX7hSJ— Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 30, 2019When the Socialist darling of the Democrat Party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was recently asked about Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, she refused to criticize him and instead chose to criticize U.S. interventionism.“I think that this is absolutely a complex issue. I think it’s important that we approach this very carefully,” Ocasio-Cortez said when asked whether she would denounce Maduro. “Myself, just like anyone else, is absolutely concerned with the humanitarian crises that’s happening, and I think it’s important that any solution we have centers the Venezuelan people and centers the democracy of the Venezuelan people first. I am very concerned about U.S. interventionism in Venezuela, and I oppose it, especially when we talk about a figure like U.S. Special Envoy Elliott Abrams here. He’s pled guilty to several crimes related to Iran-Contra. I am generally opposed to U.S. interventionism as a principle, but particularly under this administration and under his leadership I think it’s a profound mistake.”No matter her insane positions, the mainstream media continues to promote her. Last month, AOC appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Last week, she was listed as one of TIME’s top 100 most influential people.Charlotte Alter, national correspondent for TIME magazine, praised Cortez, saying: “[Ocasio-Cortez is] a democratic socialist at a time when confidence in capitalism is declining, especially among progressive millennials.”The journalist cheered: “She’s a political phenomenon: part activist, part legislator, arguably the best storyteller in the party since Barack Obama and perhaps the only Democrat right now with the star power to challenge President Donald Trump’s.”Alter took to Twitter to praise the socialist lawmaker.

According to the FBI report, the investigation is centered on Americans who are helping with the migrant caravan is ongoing, and includes an alleged plot by ANTIFA to obtain guns from a Mexican cartel that would be sold to protesters.At the center of the investigation is Ivan Reibeling, who in the FBI report is described as a “Mexico-based cartel associate known as Cobra Commander AKA the Mexican Rambo.”The San Diego Union-Tribune reports – When federal law enforcement officials last year began collecting dossiers on mostly American journalists, activists and lawyers in Tijuana involved with the migrant caravan, one part of their investigation focused on an alleged plot by a drug cartel to sell guns to protesters, according to a Federal Bureau of Investigation report.A Dec. 18, 2018, document from the FBI, obtained by the Union-Tribune, specifies an alleged plan for activists to purchase guns from a “Mexico-based cartel associate known as Cobra Commander,” or Ivan Riebeling.The protesters wanted to “stage an armed rebellion at the border,” the FBI reported to dozens of federal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and Mexico.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The unclassified report was provided to the Union-Tribune on the condition the person providing it would not be named, and with the request that the entire document not be shared online because of the ongoing nature of the investigation.The document warns of “anti-fascist activists” that “planned to disrupt U.S. law enforcement and military security operations at the US/Mexican border.”In March, it was discovered that Customs and Border Protection had compiled lists of people it wanted to stop for questioning at the border. Agents questioned or arrested at least 21 of them, according to documents obtained by NBC San Diego. On that list, Ian Reibeling is described as an “instigator,” Evan Duke’s name and picture is also included.The two people named in the report, Ivan Riebeling and Evan Duke, said the accusations are untrue and illogical.CBP said the names on the list are people who were present when violence broke out at the Tijuana border in November and January when agents deployed tear gas. The agency said people were being questioned so that the agency could learn more about what started the altercations.Some of the people detained and questioned said they were asked whether anyone was encouraging migrants to rush the border during the two incidents.

That’s when his mic went dead!“Exactly”Berry claimed:“But that’s not free speech, threats are not free speech. I don’t think you should say that because that’s confusing the issue.”Ocasio-Cortez continues to yammer on while Berry becomes more and more upset that he can’t be heard:“I just want to introduce some nuance to the conversation,” she said. “I’m just trying to introduce some nuance to the conversation. I’m not trying to have an argument here, I want to have a discussion. I’m absolutely open to being proven wrong on many issues. I’ll just let you know my perspective. My perspective is that we absolutely have protected freedom of speech. Someone can say ‘I hate so-and-so’ and that is protected speech.”You still can’t hear Berry who tries to respond to the lecture and then a lackey for AOC comes over to speak with Berry who was really agitated that he couldn’t respond:“If you didn’t turn my mic off, I wouldn’t have to raise my voice. You fascists turned my mic off.”This is where it gets totally absurd because Ocasio-Cortez finally tells someone they can turn Berry’s mic back on:“Oh sir, no, no. You can turn his mic on, you didn’t have to turn it off.”AOC continued to lecture Berry:“I think for me sir, my concern is we have the freedom to say I hate this, or I hate that. Where I do get concerned is where that line is played with so that we have plausible deniability to incite violence against people. I don’t think the president should have tweeted that video that he tweeted.” She was referring to President Trump tweeting out a video with shots from 9/11 and Rep. Ilhan Omar saying “some people did something”. Omar claimed the tweet lead to death threats.Ocasio-Cortez continues:“Do I think he should have gone to jail for it? Absolutely not…But I don’t think he should have done that. I think by endangering Congresswoman Omar he was playing with this line…”Berry shot back in disagreement:“Well, I disagree. She endangered herself.  That’s not endangerment by showing a true video. So showing the truth is endangerment, is inciting violence, to show the truth. That is fascism. His right to show the truth of what happened is just as valid as her right to say whatever she wants to say.”The argument continues with Ocasio-Cortez clearly getting steamed at the very persistent Mr. Berry.

Kamala Harris resigned Wednesday after The Sacramento Bee inquired about a $400,000 harassment and retaliation settlement resulting from his time working for Harris at the California Department of Justice.Larry Wallace, who served as the director of the Division of Law Enforcement under then-Attorney General Harris, was accused by his former executive assistant in December 2016 of “gender harassment” and other demeaning behavior, including frequently asking her to crawl under his desk to change the paper in his printer.The lawsuit was filed on Dec. 30, 2016, when Harris was still attorney general but preparing to be sworn in as California’s newly elected Democratic senator. It was settled less than five months later, in May 2017, by Xavier Becerra, who was appointed to replace her as attorney general.By that time, Wallace had transitioned to work for Harris as a senior advisor in her Sacramento office.“We were unaware of this issue and take accusations of harassment extremely seriously. This evening, Mr. Wallace offered his resignation to the senator and she accepted it,” Harris spokeswoman Lily Adams wrote in an email.Harris, who has said she will decide over the holidays whether to run for president in 2020, has been a prominent figure in the #MeToo movement against workplace sexual harassment. Last year, she was among a group of female senators that were the first to call for the resignation of Sen. Al Franken after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct, and she introduced a bill in June to ban forced nondisclosure agreements in harassment settlements.During her questioning, Harris asked Kavanaugh, “Have you had any conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at” the law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres.Kavanaugh responded by saying he wasn’t sure who works at that specific firm, which employs an estimated 300 people.Harris begins with a vague, leading question that can be misinterpreted in any number of ways. The senator then belittles the witness by claiming the question isn’t complicated. She then offers to clarify the question, all the while pretending to be precise, and then restates her original, confusing line of inquiry almost verbatim.This sort of interrogation is designed to trick a scared and ill-informed suspect into saying something that can later be twisted and used against him by the prosecution. In many cases, this tactic works. But Kavanaugh was smart enough to insist on precise language, much to Harris’ obvious chagrin. Unfortunately, a lot of the people who get caught up in the criminal justice system don’t have Kavanaugh’s background or presence of mind. These people often find themselves on the losing end of the underhanded word games preferred by prosecutors like Harris.All of this is to say: Wednesday’s interaction between Harris and Kavanaugh reminds me of the senator’s shameful record when she served as the district attorney of San Francisco and as California’s attorney general.In that position, she was a petty tyrant who regularly advocated for absurdly harsh penalties, all while protecting her corrupt friends in government. She was a cheerleader for civil asset forfeiture. She championed an anti-truancy law that called for a $2,000 fine and jail time for the parents (by 2012, two mothers were imprisoned in California under this law). She even opposed attempts to do away with the state’s draconian three-strikes law, which called for life sentences for a third “strike” even if it was only a minor felony.Watch the exchange here:",fake

A suspect was taken into custody approximately two miles away from the synagogue while three patients were rushed to a nearby hospital.A man with a rifle entered Chabad of Poway on Rancho Bernardo Road, west of Interstate 15 at 11:23 a.m. and opened fire on the people inside, law enforcement officials said.“We didn’t hear him screaming or saying anything. He was just focused to kill. You saw the hate and the murder in his eyes,” one witness told NBC 7. “He had a vest and he had clips in the vest. He was ready. He was ready. He came in to kill.”As the suspect fled the scene, an off-duty U.S. Border Patrol agent who was in the synagogue at the time of the shooting opened fire on the suspect, missing the man but striking his vehicle, Gore said.The suspect John T. Earnest, 19, of San Diego, does not have a criminal history and has no apparent connection with white supremacist groups, according to San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore.Multiple law enforcement sources confirm to NBC News that the suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting is 19-year-old John T.

35,26-Apr-19,"Illegal immigrants are demanding driver’s licenses in the blue state of Michigan ahead of the upcoming 2020 elections. They’re also threatening a day where they refuse to show up for work and keep their kids home from school. What’s interesting, is the media reporting on this group’s efforts to obtain driver’s licenses prior to the 2020 elections, never mentions that people living in Michigan who are undocumented, are breaking the law.The Cosecha Michigan group is organizing the May 1st March for driver’s licenses for illegal aliens in three major cities in Michigan. The pro-illegal immigration group is also telling illegal aliens to stay home from work on that day and to keep their kids out of school, as a way to protest the injustices they face while illegally living in the United States.From the Cosecha group’s Facebook page:This May 1st will be another day without immigrants in the state of Michigan! Don’t go to work, don’t go to school, don’t buy — we will be on the streets, marching to demand licenses for everyone.
According to the Detroit News – Leaders with Movimiento Cosecha Michigan, which fights for permanent protection for immigrants, have planned marches Wednesday in Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Kalamazoo.The planned day of action is in coordination with “Driving Without Fear” immigrant marches the same day in cities across the country, including New Jersey, Indiana, Georgia and Wisconsin.Organizers urge Michigan immigrants and allies to be absent from work, keep children home from school, businesses to close, officials said at a press conference Thursday outside Michigan State Capitol in Lansing.“This May 1, immigrants from all over Michigan will be taking the streets in Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Kalamazoo to demand the right to drive without fear. Together, we will show the power and dignity of our community.”The video posted by Cosecha Michigan on their Facebook page appears to be a warning to businesses, farmers that undocumented workers will leave them to fend for themselves on May 1st. Perhaps May 1st would be a good day for American businesses to think about hiring American citizens looking for work. There are an awful lot of high school kids, or students coming home from college looking for work this summer.The Cosecha group has also threatened to pull undocumented kids from their classrooms. An empty classroom is shown in the video, while ominous music plays in the background. Cosecha should be careful with their portrayal of empty classrooms after undocumented kids are removed from them, they may give American citizens the impression they don’t care about getting free education for their kids. They might also point out how helpful it would be to students who are American citizens if the number of students in their classrooms wasn’t at capacity. Parents might also recognize the benefit of not watching their kids education be dumbed down to help students coming from other nations with sub-par educations and foreign language barriers.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Watch:El Grito por las licencias – May 1, 2019Este 1ro de Mayo será otro día sin inmigrantes en el estado de Michigan!

43,22-Apr-19,"Mark Levin is fuming and is warning Americans who are Trump supporters that we’ll have a new political battle on our hands in the coming months. The battle is one in which the Democrats will do everything in their power to destroy President Trump. The Democrats are determined to impeach Trump and will be going all out to use anything they can to do so.Levin has already called out the shenanigans from Robert Mueller and his team of 19 angry Democrats (see below). Their volume two of the Mueller Report is full of hearsay testimony from different people. It has not been vetted and hasn’t come under legal scrutiny in court via cross-examination. Levin got down to basics when he called it “crap.”Levin is now warning Americans who voted for Trump that we need to stand with him in a new political battle like no other:“The tens of millions of Americans who voted for President Trump and do not live in Nadler’s district, Schiff’s district, Pelosi’s district, etc., need to get ready for a political battle the likes of which we have not seen in modern times. These political leftists who represent these dark blue districts are obsessed with removing and destroying President Trump. And these leftists need to understand that tens of millions of us will not stand quietly for this; we will not be disenfranchised by them.” – Mark Levin…represent these dark blue districts are obsessed with removing and destroying President Trump. And these leftists need to understand that tens of millions of us will not stand quietly for this, we will not be disenfranchised by them.  https://t.co/ilLTuUdqxo— Mark R.

Levin called this plan out when he said Mueller wrote volume two of the report to set up reasons for impeachment.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON LEVIN’S TAKE ON VOLUME TWO OF MUELLER REPORT:Mark Levin is livid about the politicization of volume two of the Mueller Report. Levin discussed with Fox & Friends’ Ed Henry the significance or insignificance of volume two of the Mueller report.The testimony by White House lawyer Don McGahn has been controversial but has not been tested by a court of law. McGahn quotes President Trump in his testimony but his testimony hasn’t been tested in a court of law. Levin challenges Ed Henry by saying we want the truth but we have no idea if what McGahn said is truthful. President Trump hasn’t had the opportunity to refute McGahn’s testimony. Levin then made a great point that in this country you are innocent until proven guilty.Levin calls Part Two of the Mueller Report a “200 Page Op-Ed” that should never have been written.He knows that this was written as fodder for CNN and MSNBC and for Democrats Schiff and Nadler:“This report, volume two, doesn’t have a syllable of legal significance. There’s not a syllable of law in it. It doesn’t matter what McGahn said or what the president said, none of it’s been tested in a court of law. There’s been no challenge to it. There’s been no cross-examination. Nothing. That’s why Mueller wrote this. This is a political document that he should never have been written. A political document that’s 200 pages long that the press keeps focusing on. That’s why he and Weissmann and the others wrote it because he knew you all — he knew CNN would be obsessed with it. He knew that MSNBC would be obsessed with it. This is an op-ed. This is a 200-page op-ed. That’s all this is. No prosecutor who wouldn’t want to be disbarred would ever produce anything like this, talking, well this guy said this, and why did the president say that? How do you know?

51,18-Apr-19,"Last week, the left cheered the arrest of Wikileaks’ Julian Assange.

Tapper then attempted to prove that Donald Trump Jr coordinated with Julian Assange. Tapper cites public tweets about Hillary email releases as evidence of collusion and ends his discussion by admitting Assange is not guilty of anything.What Tapper and reporter Laura Jarrett didn’t mention during their discussion, however, is that the Mueller report reveals why Julian Assange wanted Trump to win and Hillary Clinton to lose the 2016 presidential election.According to Summit News – Assange, who was arrested last week and faces extradition to the United States, thought that it would be far harder for Trump to start wars given his platform and opposition from Republicans.“GOP will generate a lot oposition [sic], including through dumb moves. Hillary will do the same thing, but co-opt the liberal opposition and the GOP opposition. Hence hillary [sic] has greater freedom to start wars than the GOP and has the will to do so,” Assange wrote.He also made it clear that he thought Hillary was a sadistic sociopath who wouldn’t hesitate to engage in military adventurism.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“[W]e believe it would be much better for GOP . . .

52,17-Apr-19,"Rashida Tlaib is proud of her Muslim Palestinian heritage. She’s also not shy about her disdain for Israel. The freshman “Impeach the motherf**ker” lawmaker, who wrapped herself in the Palestinian flag to celebrate her election victory in November, has many anti-Semitic ties. Most recently, Tlaib traveled across the country to support an academic boycott of Israel at a California college.According to Washington Free Beacon -Students and faculty of California’s Pitzer College voted Thursday to suspend the study abroad partnership with Israel’s University of Haifa, but college president Melvin Oliver is declining to take any action on the program, calling it an “academic boycott of Israel.”Dan Segal, (pictured below with Rep.Tlaib) is the far-left professor who led the charge for the anti-Israel proposal and met with Tlaib to discuss it.The anti-Israel proposal, backed by radical leftist groups and Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, won the support of the Pitzer College Council in a Thursday vote taken by both students and faculty. Oliver says the vote amounts only to a recommendation to the president and is declining to take it.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Tlaib is a member of the Facebook group “Palestinian American Congress,” where members often demonize Jews. The group’s founder, Palestinian activist Maher Abdel-qader, was a key fundraiser for Tlaib and organized campaign events for her around the country.In January 2018, Abdel-qader shared an anti-Semitic video that claimed Jews aren’t actually Jewish, and invented their historical claim to Israel and secretly control the media.Tlaib also questioned in a tweet whether Republicans who support anti-BDS legislation “forgot what country they represent.” Tlaib supports the BDS movement, which has often overlapped with anti-Semitic causes.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and other Republicans accused Tlaib of questioning Jewish-Americans’ loyalty to their country, though Tlaib insisted there was no anti-Semitic intent to the tweet.Now, the National Review is reporting that Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) hosted an extremist anti-Israel activist who has openly and explicitly endorsed terrorism at her congressional office in mid-April to celebrate the American Muslims for Palestine Advocacy Day.The organization American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), which organized the meeting, posted a photo on its Facebook page of Tlaib standing next to Joe Catron, a veteran anti-Israel activist who has openly praised various Palestinian organizations for committing acts of terrorism.“A tip of my hat to Rashida Tlaib, who really goes above and beyond the call of duty in welcoming every supporter of Palestine to her office, listening to what we have to say, answering our questions, and posing for endless pictures,” Catron wrote on Facebook in a post first noted by the Daily Caller.Catron serves as U.S. coordinator of the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, an arm of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which the U.S., Australia, Japan, Canada, and the E.U. have all designated a terrorist organization.Here’s a screenshot of Joe Catron’s Twitter account. Hmmm…is anyone else wondering where those rockets are headed or who for whom that target is intended? What about the terrorist on the right? This is certainly not your typical Twitter banner…According to the Daily Caller, the woman standing next to Catron in his Twitter profile image is Leila Khaled, a member of PFLP who is a known Palestinian terrorist most notable for hijacking airplanes.In 2017, Catron used his personal Twitter account to praise a PFLP-organized terror attack in which an Israeli police officer was stabbed to death. Catron shared the PFLP’s official statement praising the members who perpetrated the murder and personally referred to the attack as “heroic.”In this tweet by Joe Catron, he expressed his love for the terror group, Hizbullah.Hezbollah or “Hizbullah” is a radical Shiite Muslim political party and militant group fighting against Israel and western occupation and influence within Lebanon.Yep…Rashida Tlaib, the Democrat United States Congresswoman from Michigan met with this man in her congressional office. As a Michigan resident, and as a United States citizen, I am very concerned that this woman has been given the awesome responsibility of voting on legislation that affects the future of our nation. ",fake

What is she talking about?Amanpour asked Pelosi, “Are you concerned that your opposition, going toward the next election, or however they wish to use it, will use that, to call—as the President has done, you know, that the Democrats are not the party or friend to the Jews?” Pelosi seemed stunned by her question, and told the CNN host that she would not respond to her question, because she was overseas. Pelosi told Amanpour, “We have no taint of that in the Democratic Party, and just because they want to accuse somebody of that doesn’t mean— uh, that we take that bait.”Amanpour asked Pelosi about the flippant comments about 9-11 Democrat Rep.

The CNN host suggested that perhaps Pelosi wasn’t swift enough to defend her fellow Democrat congresswoman.

54,17-Apr-19,"Triple amputee veteran, Brian Kolfage, is the most seriously wounded U.S. Air Force member to survive his injuries. Last year, after it became obvious that the Democrat Party leaders in Congress were not going to help President Trump build a wall on our southern border, Kolfage started his own Go Fund Me fundraiser. Kolfage wanted to find a way to get around the obstructionist lawmakers in D.C. and give U.S. citizens the ability to directly contribute to the construction of a wall on our southern border. To date, Kolfage and his team of committed patriots have raised over $26 million on their Go Fund Me site.Brian took a trip to our southern border last week, and what he discovered was stunning.As a way to show Americans how easy it is to cross the border from Mexico into the U.S., Brian asked members of his team to film him crossing in his wheelchair, using only one arm to push himself across the New Mexico border. According to Kolfage, the Obama administration denied the construction of a border wall at the New Mexico site, because it was designated as a “natural barrier.”  Kris Kobach, former Kansas Secretary of State, who is part of Brian Kolfage’s We Build The Wall team, can be seen standing next to the sign designating the border at the “natural barrier.”In the video below, Kolfage can be seen easily crossing over into Juarez, Mexico from a rural area of New Mexico, just outside of Columbus. The point where he crosses over into Mexico is where Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico meet.  The next day, Kolfage wheeled into Mexico from El Paso, Texas, claiming it was, “easy to do.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Watch:While in New Mexico, Kolfage and his team met up with a group of former Green Beret and Special Forces veterans who make up a volunteer militia on the border. The volunteer militia helps to fill in the gaps for our US Border Patrol agents who are currently dealing with a mass invasion of our border. This video was taken last night at the New Mexico border.  The video shows hundreds of illegal aliens who literally just crossed the Mexico border into the United States. The volunteer militia was able to hold this massive crowd of illegal aliens in place until the U.S. Border agents could get to them, round them up, and process them.Brian Kolfage talked to a U.S. Border Agent who expressed the frustration the agents are dealing with, as they attempt to process the massive influx of illegal aliens. The U.S. Border agent, who will remain nameless, told Brian that they are processing illegal aliens that they know are criminals, including hit-men who work for the drug cartels, but since they have kids with them, the border agents are being forced to release them into the general public in the U.S.Kolfage and his team found piles of documents that would identify the illegal aliens, strewn on the southern border. According to Kolfage, the ID’s they found discarded by the migrants were probably thrown away, so they could get a fresh start with new identities and no criminal records to follow them into the U.S. Kolfage found an ID (seen in the photo below) on the Mexico-U.S. border. It appears to be from a Cuban man by the name of Hernandez Lopez Ronier. We are unable to verify the authenticity of the ID.According to Kolfage, the border agent he spoke with revealed that illegal aliens who make it through to New Mexico, are given the exact same ID as New Mexico residents. If they come with children, they are held for 48 hours, and are then sent back to Mexico, or bussed or flown to various locations around the United States. According to the unnamed border agent, the top three destinations where the illegal aliens are being delivered to, are New York, Miami, and Los Angeles.According to the border agent, illegal aliens who make it through with one child or more, are granted with emergency welfare, entitling them to a welfare credit (EBT) card loaded with $1000 per adult and $400 per child. According to Kolfage, the agent told him that the card could be reloaded every month from wherever the illegal alien is living. The border agent also allegedly claims that in addition to the welfare payments, the illegal aliens are also given a “right to work” pass for five years, and are told they could have up to a 5-year waiting period before they face an immigration judge. According to Brian, immigrants who come through our immigration system legally, are only given a 2-year right to work pass.Kolfage shared a couple of images he took through the wall into Juarez, Mexico.Apparently, the Mexican drug dealers aren’t fans of President Trump, as evidenced by the “F*ck Trump” graffiti painted on the wall of this unfinished cinder-block wall. The garbage the illegal immigrants are leaving behind on the U.S border looks very similar to the trash strewn around on the Mexican side.This image shows the abrupt end of a so-called border wall in New Mexico.This photo is a reminder of the constant danger our U.S. Border agents face. The image of the U.S Border patrol vehicle shows cages that have been affixed to the windows to prevent rocks and boulders from smashing through and harming or even killing the brave agents inside.An 85-yr-old Vietnam U.S. Air Force veteran fighter pilot relayed how dangerous and challenging life on the border is for U.S. citizens. He told fellow Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage about a new BBQ he recently bought and placed on his property. It was stolen within four hours. Kolfage also shared a video that he told us was taken at a La Quinta hotel in El Paso, TX only two nights ago. Brian claims hotels on the border are overloaded with migrants. Kolfage claims that about 300 new people arrived that night at the La Quinta hotel in El Paso, TX.The border agent also shared stories about diseases that the migrants are bringing with them across the border and told how border agents were recently forced to release everyone from their holding facility to decontaminate it after it was discovered that most of the population was infected with smallpox.These are just stories from one U.S. border agent. It’s stunning to think about how little the American public really knows or understands about the crisis on our southern border. If only we had journalists who really cared about how our country is being invaded.We’d love to know what you think about these discoveries. Do you think the United States is facing a crisis on our southern border? Will a border wall fix this issue? Please share your thoughts in the comment section below.",fake
55,16-Apr-19,"Michelle Obama was in London promoting her book when she took swipe after swipe at President Trump during an interview with Stephen Colbert. This just proves President Trump living rent-free in her head.It’s an unwritten rule that former inhabitants of the White House are not supposed to bad mouth the new inhabitants of the White House. Michelle and Barack didn’t get the memo and have been bitterly slamming President Trump since he’s been in office.While in London, Michelle compared President Trump to a “divorced dad” who makes everyone “sick”. An odd comparison, but she went with it. What she probably didn’t expect is that divorced dads would clap back at her to tell her to knock it off with badmouthing them too:According to TMZ, some sensitive divorced dads took offense at the intimation divorced dads are somehow lesser than divorced moms.Someone tweeted, “I admire @MichelleObama, but I really wish she wouldn’t use divorced dads as a metaphor for Trump. I hear some of them are quite awesome.” Someone else said, “As a divorced dad, I do my best to raise my son into a kind of man of which we all can be proud.

It’s called “going low.” Remember Michelle said, “when they go low, we go high.” Somewhere along the way, she forgot to do that…During an appearance in London last weekend, Michelle Obama bashed President Trump oddly comparing him to a “divorced dad” who is making America “sick.”:“We come from a broken family; we are a little unsettled. Sometimes you spend the weekend with divorced dad. That feels like fun, but then you get sick. That is what America is going through. We are living with divorced dad.”Obama also implied that President Trump was never prepared to be president, saying the presidency reveals who someone truly is:“We were always ourselves…the presidency does not change who you are; it reveals who you are. It is like swimming in the ocean with great waves. If you are not a great swimmer, you are not going to learn in the middle of a tidal wave. You are going to resort to your kicking and drowning and what you knew how to do in the pool.”Obama also said America is currently in a “dark” place”:“This may feel like a dark chapter, but any story has its highs and lows, but it continues. Yes, we are in a low, but we have been lower. We have had tougher times; we have had more to fear. We have lived through slavery, the Holocaust and segregation, We have always come out at the other end…better and stronger. We are moving in a direction of diversity and inclusion. No one ever said it would be easy. We are just in the throes of the uneasy path of change.”Can she just knock off the Trump bashing?",fake

As our State Department continues to seed small and large communities across America, expect to see more and more of these results.

Somalis in other states supported her, including Washington state and Ohio.Kahn was actually beaten by two Somalis–Omar and Mohamud Noor. She had only 1,726 votes to Omar’s 2,404 votes.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) prefers to remember the worst terror attack on American soil as, “Some people did something” on 9-11.The best part of the discussion from the money grubbing Clintons came when former President Clinton, the person responsible for signing of the disastrous NAFTA deal that devastated factories and factory jobs in Michigan, chimed in on how we need a “serious discussion” about “how to bring more jobs to places that feel left out and left behind.” Clinton then took a jab at President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, that he, himself used on teh campaign trail mutliple times, after copying it from Ronald Reagan. Clinton, continued to bash Trump’s jobs market that just reached the lowest unemployment num But you can’t do it with slogans and smears” Clinton told the audience to cheers.According to the Economic Policy Institute – The North American Free Trade Agreement (NATFA) was the door through which American workers were shoved into the neoliberal global labor market.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]By establishing the principle that U.S. corporations could relocate production elsewhere and sell back into the United States, NAFTA undercut the bargaining power of American workers, which had driven the expansion of the middle class since the end of World War II. The result has been 20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income, wealth and political power.NAFTA caused the loss of some 700,000 jobs as production moved to Mexico. Most of these losses came in California, Texas, Michigan, and other states where manufacturing is concentrated. The vast majority of workers who lost jobs from NAFTA suffered a permanent loss of income.NAFTA strengthened the ability of U.S. employers to force workers to accept lower wages and benefits. As soon as NAFTA became law, corporate managers began telling their workers that their companies intended to move to Mexico unless the workers lowered the cost of their labor. In the midst of collective bargaining negotiations with unions, some companies would even start loading machinery into trucks that they said were bound for Mexico. The same threats were used to fight union organizing efforts. The message was: “If you vote in a union, we will move south of the border.” With NAFTA, corporations also could more easily blackmail local governments into giving them tax reductions and other subsidies.The destructive effect of NAFTA on the Mexican agricultural and small business sectors dislocated several million Mexican workers and their families and was a major cause in the dramatic increase in undocumented workers flowing into the U.S. labor market.The NAFTA doctrine of socialism for capital and free markets for labor also drove U.S. policy in the Mexican peso crisis of 1994-95, the Asia financial crash of 1997 and the global financial meltdown of 2008. In each case, the U.S. government organized the rescue of the world’s bank and corporate investors, and let the workers fend for themselves.Watch, as Bill and Hillary pander to Detroiters in the same state where Hillary couldn’t be bothered to campaign while running for President against Donald Trump in 2016.Much like demons, the Clinton’s have been cast out and discarded from the Democrat Party. The only thing they have left is Hillary’s appeal to the hard left feminist element and the Resist Trump crowd who just can’t seem to get over Hillary’s 2016 election loss to the outspoken outsider, and the Clinton’s are clinging to them like a life raft to keep their slush-fund/charity alive.",fake

64,11-Apr-19,"A bitter Meghan McCain celebrated the arrest of Wikileaks’ Julian Assange today in a way that her father would be proud of.During a discussion on ‘The View’ about the arrest of Assange (see below) today, McCain gave a brutal response to what should happen to him:“I hope he rots in Hell.”…She is her father’s daughter. However anyone feels about Mr. Assange, this is crass and unprofessional on McCain’s part.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=66&v=Q6QSzhqZFCoTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Transcript of exchange on ‘The View’:WHOOPI GOLDBERG: After being holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy for the past seven years, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been arrested. He faces charges in the U.S. for conspiring to hack into a classified government computer. WikiLeaks tweeted that he’s won dozens of journalism awards, nominated for a Nobel prize every year since 2010, and this is just a campaign by the CIA to delegitimatize and dehumanize — I almost said dehumidify. So what do you think it is? Why is this happening? Did he break the law? Is it a problem?JOY BEHAR: Well, remember what he did originally. He hacked into the Democrats’ computers and helped Trump get elected, basically, by exposing Podesta’s emails and then Comey went after Hillary. Remember that? That’s why Trump won, basically.ABBY HUNTSMAN: He’s been doing it since 2010, as far as I know. And that’s when Trump did an interview in 2010 and said that he hated this guy and he thought he deserved the death penalty along those lines. In 2016, when he was hacking the DNC, he promoted him. He said he loved WikiLeaks and basically promoted information he was sharing. […] But, here’s the weird thing, though, is even after praising him, it was under the Trump administration — the DOJ, in 2017, that prosecuted Julian Assange. Obama and Holder could have done that the year before and they punted it. So, that’s where I get confused — where you hear Trump praising the guy, and under his administration, they are the ones that actually prosecuted him.MEGHAN MCCAIN: The politics of this have always been completely hypocritical on both sides. Eric Holder under Obama decided against prosecution of Assange over concerns that WikiLeaks was a “journalistic organization that would raise First Amendment Issues.” Chelsea Manning was granted clemency. Chelsea Manning in 2010 released 750,000 classified and sensitive military documents that put our national security at risk. Under the Obama administration, she was given clemency. This is something that a lot of people who put national security first — I put myself in this category — have been warning about, and warning about, and warning about. The only time the Democrats started caring was when it started affecting them politically, and Hillary Clinton’s emails were released and John Podesta’s emails were released.GOLDBERG: What is going to happen to him? That’s my question.MCCAIN: I hope he rots in Hell!",fake
65,11-Apr-19,"Two days ago, a man whose first name is “Africa,” confronted “Reverend” Matsimela Mapfumo (Mark Thompson), Host of “Make it Plain” on Sirius XM. Reverend Thompson can be seen and heard regularly hosting “Make It Plain” with a #GetWoke banner hanging behind him on Sirius XM. Thompson can also be found as a regular guest on MSNBC.The man being attacked in the video goes by the name of “Africa,” and is part of the #ADOS movement or American Descendants of Slaves.Yvette Carnell, the co-founder of #ADOS, retweeted the video, saying: After watching the video, it is CLEAR that @ministter owes both this man and #ADOS an apology. He got mad at being called a sellout and got physical. There is no excuse for his behavior, or the slanderous lies that followed.Africa confronted the Sirius XM host telling him that he gets frustrated by Mark Thompson’s rhetoric on MSNBC that seems to only focus on Russia. Africa told him as a “poor black man from the inner city, ” he doesn’t care about Russia or Putin. Africa told him, “My kid’s education is horrible. They have no jobs.” Africa admitted, “I have a felony, so I really can’t get a job.” Africa asked him, “How do I get someone at MSNBC to speak for me?” Thompson attempted to convince Africa that he cares about black people as much as he cares about destroying Donald Trump with the fake Russian collusion narrative, saying,  “I do talk about those things on MSNBC.” Africa corrected him, saying, “When the Mueller report came out, you was highly concerned. But to us, the average black person, we don’t care about Russia.” A frustrated Thompson told Africa, “That’s not true! We have to care about everything. We have a President…” Africa cut him off, saying, “But Russia’s not the one that’s killing me!” Thompson pointed his finger in Africa’s face, telling him, “No, Russia is…Russia is.”When Thompson attempted to walk away, things became heated. Africa accused Thompson of not having time to speak to him about matters that the poor black community cares about. As Africa stepped to the side to prevent Thompson from leaving and dodging his question, Thompson became furious. That’s when Africa accused the liberal host of being a “coon” and a “sellout.” A woman can be seen approaching the two men, as appeared to plead with Africa to back off. That’s when the Sirius XM host and frequent guest on MSNBC punched Africa in the head.#ADOS #FBA here it is. As you can clearly see @ministter was the one that got physical first.

Black leaders are touting Trump’s historic prison reform legislation that disproportionately affected young, black men. Meanwhile, Democrat Party presidential hopefuls are propping up false reparations packages that they know will never pass Congress.In this outrageous MSNBC interview, SIRIUS XM radio host Mark Thompson claims baby Jesus may have died under Trump.Carnell told Intercept magazine the hashtag ADOS was started two years ago, because “we thought there wasn’t enough policy…for Americans who descended from slavery and had ancestors who lived through Jim Crow, reconstruction, all of that, so we came up with this hashtag.”On February 7, 2019, Ann Coulter admitted that she likes the #ADOS movement, focused on policy for Americans who descended from slaves, but believes Haitian and Moroccan slaves should not be a part of the movement.Will Sirius XM fire the host for assaulting another black man on video?

66,11-Apr-19,"Yesterday, the New York Post hailed Ohio State defensive end Nick Bosa as the “best player in the [NFL] draft,” saying that it would be “remarkable” if Bosa “fell to the Jets” in the NFL draft. The NFL draft will take place in Nashville on April 25th.One hour later, they published an article about how Bosa removed all of his social media posts that reflected his conservative views. Bosa claims he removed them over his concern about affecting his chances with the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL draft.New York Post reports – Nick Bosa has wiped some of his Twitter slate clean. The Ohio State defensive end, who is projected to be one of the top picks in this month’s NFL draft, told ESPN he deleted certain posts, including a 2016 tweet in which he called former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick a “clown,” due to his potential landing spot.From the ESPN interview – Nick reluctantly admits, and has interests outside of football. (He’ll make his acting debut with a small role in the final season of Game of Thrones on HBO this spring.) Nick loves football more, he says-“I was full-on into it from the time I was 7. Joey, not as much.” He’s also more politically minded. Last year he seemed to delight in posting political takes, including his support for President Trump, on Twitter and needling dissenters. (He also caused a minor social media stir by criticizing Beyonce, Black Panther and Colin Kaepernick, all eventually deleted.) As the combine drew near, though, his online behavior grew increasingly bland. I asked why he seemed to abandon something he had previously embraced.“I had to,” he says. “There is a chance I might end up in San Francisco.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Here’s a screenshot of the Bosa’s tweet about the former San Fransisco 49ers QB, turned Black Lives Matter activist and anti-American agitator, Colin Kaepernick.Bosa, 21, had previously “quote tweeted a picture of Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan with the caption, ‘Goats,’” per Sports Illustrated. ESPN also noted Bosa’s “online behavior grew increasingly bland” leading up to the NFL combine in early March, though he had previously praised the president during his time at Ohio State.What has happened to our country? When did America agree to allow the Democrat Party to bully and destroy anyone who didn’t agree with their radical liberal ideology?

67,11-Apr-19,"Since the college admissions scandal broke last month, there’s been a lot of discussion around the topic of unfair admission policies at colleges across America. But what about one of the most disturbing trends in colleges? What about the 17 states that are giving illegal aliens free tuition, while making students who are American citizens pay the full rate of tuition?In New York, lawmakers have taken it a step further. Two days ago, they voted down a bill that would have given kids whose parents died in the line of duty, while serving in our military the opportunity to attend college without paying tuition. Their vote took place only one week after they voted to give illegal aliens free tuition.Syracuse.com reports – New York lawmakers on Tuesday refused to advance a bill that would have provided free college tuition to the families of military personnel from the state who were killed in the line of duty.The Assembly’s Higher Education Committee voted 15 to 11 to hold the bipartisan bill, effectively ending its chances of making it to a floor vote this session.
The move comes a week after lawmakers passed a $175 billion state budget that included $27 million to provide college tuition aid for undocumented immigrants.Some Central New York lawmakers said it was outrageous to block a bill that would likely cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to help children of military members who died for their county.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]
“It’s disgraceful,” said Assemblyman Gary Finch, R-Springport. “Soldiers who lay down their lives and make the ultimate sacrifice represent the best of us. The children they love so dearly deserve access to the opportunity and promise that is the hallmark of this country. I can’t imagine what’s in your heart when you vote ‘no’ on a bill like this.”
Four Democrats, including Assemblyman Al Stirpe, D-Cicero, split with their party and voted against holding the bill in committee.Assemblyman Will Barclay, R-Pulaski, one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said in an interview after the vote that he sensed Democrats simply didn’t want to pass the bill because it was authored by a Republican, Steve Hawley, R-Batavia.According to Value Colleges – 17 states have passed legislation that allows immigrant students at any stage in the process towards citizenship to receive in-state college tuition status, provided that they meet certain criteria. These states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington State.To take advantage of these programs a non-citizen student must apply for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an immigration policy founded by the Obama administration in June of 2012. Other conditions of receiving in-state status include attending two or more years of high school in that state, coming from a low-income family (the exact annual income varies by state) and ensuring that the student will apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as possible. For other states, immigrants will need an F-1 student visa to attend college in the U.S.",fake

It’s a big deal.The generation I grew up in, which is the Vietnam war period, people were all concerned about spying on anti-war people and so forth by the government; and there were a lot of rules put in place to ensure there was an adequate basis for before our law enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance.  I’m not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it’s important to look at that, and I’m not just talking about the FBI necessarily, but the intelligence agencies more broadly.Shaheen: So your not, you’re not suggesting though that spying occurred?Barr: I don’t, well, I guess you could, I think there’s that spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur.Shaheen: Wow, let me, uh…Barr: But the question is: whether it was predicated. Adequately predicated.

70,10-Apr-19,"Peel back the layers of freshman US Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and there’s quite a bit more to see than freshman “impeach the motherf**ker” lawmaker would probably like the public to see.Let’s start with the night the Muslim lawmaker won the election and wrapped herself in the Palestinian flag, while she hugged her Palestinian mother, claiming her relatives in Palestine were cheering on her victory. Note, the lack of American flags in the room.According to the Washington Free Beacon, Congresswoman-elect Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) did not disclose the name of the source of funds for a fellowship that was paid by liberal billionaire George Soros—as required by the House ethics committee—and also disclosed a lesser amount than she received, according to a review of tax and financial disclosure forms.On the day of her swearing-in, Tlaib added a sticky note to the map in her Congressional office, with the word “Palestine” written on it and an arrow pointed next to Israel. As a side note, the United States does not recognize the “Palestine” territory as a state, but the newly elected U.S. lawmaker clearly does. The map can be seen in the image below, that shows Tlaib standing next to radical anti-Semite activist Linda Sarsour (on Tlaibs left, wearing a purple hijab). Tlaib can be seen wearing a traditional Palestinian dress and was later sworn in on a Quran. To the casual observer, Tlaib’s career as a U.S. lawmaker, so far, looks more like that of a lawmaker who’s being sworn into office in Palestine than the United States of America.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]When the former Wall Street Journal journalist, Asra Q. Nomani, attempted to enter Tlaib’s office after her swearing-in ceremony, she was promptly blocked from entering the newly confirmed US lawmaker’s office by CAIR (Council for Arab Islamic Relations) an organization that has been listed a terror group by the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and anti-Semite activist, Linda Sarsour.In????????today, I reported on CAIR & Linda Sarsour anti-Israel, anti-Semitic #IStandWithIlhan lobbying.

Nomani, PI (@AsraNomani) March 7, 2019Later that evening, Tlaib addressed a crowd of her supporters at a party celebrating her swearing-in ceremony. An emotional Tlaib stood in front of a microphone and told her supporters that she made a promise to her little boy about how she would deal with President Trump, telling him that she was going to “impeach the motherf**ker!”According to Tlaib’s father, she falsely reported living in Detroit in order to run for a seat in Michigan’s 12th District. Her father claims Tlaib was living in Dearborn during her campaign and moved a family home after the election.MLive reports that Tlaib’s father, Harbi Elabed, told Detroit News rogue columnist Charlie LeDuff that his daughter didn’t live in the district where she ran for office as an MI State Rep.The Detroit News, March 11: Asked why he was tattling on his daughter, Harbi Elabed said it was a growing litany of transgressions that his daughter committed upon him — culminating in a dispute about the care of his aged mother, who suffers from dementia. According to Harbi, his daughter sided against him and in favor of his nephew in a battle of custody, a complete breach of family values, he said.Only one month ago, Tlaib spoke during a CAIR meeting in Chicago. Tlaib starting out by speaking in Arabic then swi, “You know, we always said ‘The Muslims are coming!’ Well, guess what? I think we’re here!” Next, Tlaib told a story about an interaction with John Dingell where he says “If you stand still enough on the river banks, you will watch your enemies float by dead.” Tlaib smiled and laughingly revealed how the now-deceased lawmaker’s words about watching her “enemies float by dead” made her feel so much better.Rashida Tlaib presents at HAMAS-linked CAIR-Chicago ConferenceRashida explains that envisioning her enemies (Lobbyists & Special Interests groups) DEAD brings her joy & inspirationCAIR is established by U.S. Muslim Brotherhood’s “Palestine Committee” which is Hamas in America pic.twitter.com/yc7kkT7PHl— Amy Mek (@AmyMek) March 5, 2019Now, the Israel Advocacy Movement has created a stunning video showing the close ties U.S. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has with not one, not two, but multiple friends who are supporters and even friends of extreme terrorists.This group dug into Rashida Tlaib's past and came up with some interesting connections.pic.twitter.com/qrHUaCjSBh— Rising serpent (@rising_serpent) April 6, 2019Here’s a post on Rashida Tlaib’s close friend and hard-left activist, Ahlam Jbara’s Facebook page, with images of Jbara posing with convicted terrorist, Rasmea OdehHere’s a video of Rashida Tlaib getting into the backseat of a vehicle with Ahlam Jbara.Posted by Ahlam Jbara on Thursday, March 29, 2018We found a few photos of Rashida Tlaib wearing a hijab, and wonder why she didn’t wear a hijab while she was campaigning?What do you think about Rashida Tlaib?

Waters wasn’t too pleased that Mnuchin had to leave so a back and forth began between the two. It’s clear that Waters felt she wasn’t getting respect from Mnuchin so she pulled a power move.

72,09-Apr-19,"Things got heated today when during a House Judiciary Committee Hearing that was supposed to focus on hate crimes in America. It’s hard for anyone to take these gotcha Democrats seriously anymore, especially when the House Judiciary Committee is headed up by hard-left Representative Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and had three hard-left activists sitting on the panel they questioned about hate crimes. The panel included three radical activist women: Eileen Hershenov, Senior Vice President Policy, Anti-Defamation League, Eva Paterson, President, Equal Justice Society in Oakland, CA, and Kristen Clarke President and Executive Director, National Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. There were two representatives from the left-leaning social media giants, Neil Potts the Public Policy Director at Facebook and Alexandria Walden, Public Policy & Government Relations, Google. Only two people appeared before the panel who were not there to make the case against whites in America, Mort A. Klein, President, Zionist Organization of America, and Turning Point USA’s Communications Director, Candace Owens.When it was Democrat Rep. Ted Lieu’s turn to talk, instead of discussing the topic of hate crimes, he used his opportunity to use an audio clip of Candace Owens speaking about nationalism and attempted to smear her with it, by falsely accusing Owens of expressing her support for Adolph Hitler.Watch, as the smug little Democrat lawmaker holds up his phone and knowingly plays an edited clip of Owens, in hopes of smearing her character, while Owens’ elderly grandfather sits behind her.  Owens told the committee and guests in the chamber, “I don’t know Ms. Owens. I’m not going to characterize her. I’m going to let her own words do the talking. So, I’m going to play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about Adolf Hitler.”.@RepTedLieu plays recording of Candace Owens: ""I don't know Ms. Owens.

Reschenthaler, the next Republican member of the committee to speak, he explained that he wanted to give Owens the opportunity to respond to Rep. Lieu’s vile accusation. Candace Owens began, “I think it’s pretty apparent that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the full clip in its entirety. He purposely presented an extracted clip…” Democrat House Judiciary Committee Chair, Jerry Nadler loudly banged his gavel and admonished Candace Owens, saying, “The witness will suspend for a moment. It is not proper to refer disparagingly to a member of the committee. Uh, the witness will not do that again.” Of course, Owens never called Lieu “stupid,” she only suggested that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid, and therefore unable to defend themselves from his sort of trickery and deceit used to assassinate her character. After Chairman Nadler finished admonishing her, he told Owens to go ahead with her response. Owens responded, “Sure, even though I was called ‘despicable.'” Nadler responded, “the witness may not respond to a member of the committee as stupid.” “I didn’t refer to him as stupid. That’s not what I said.  That’s not what I said at all. You didn’t listen to what I said. May I continue?” Nadler was clearly shaken by Owens, who refused to be bullied by the leftist lawmakers, conceded, telling her to go ahead.As I said, he is assuming that black people will not go pursue the full two-hour clip. He’s trying to present as if I’m launching a defense of Hitler in Germany, when in fact, the question that was asked of me was pertaining to whether or not I believed in nationalism and if nationalism was bad? What I responded was that I do not believe that we should not be characterizing Hitler as a nationalist, he was a homicidal, psychopathic, maniac, that killed his own people. A nationalist would not kill their own people. That is exactly what I was referring to in the clip and he purposely wanted to give you a cut-up, similar to what they do to Donald Trump to create a different narrative. That was unbelievably dishonest, and he did not allow me to respond to it, which is worrisome and should tell you a lot about where people are today in terms of trying to drum up narratives.” Owens went on to admonish the dirty Democrat by reminding him that she sat for 18 hours on a plane to travel to Israel to attend the US Embassy opening. Owens gave the smug lawmaker one last shot before ending her savage response to the dishonest Dem, “I’m deeply offended by the insinuation of revealing that clip without the question that was asked of me.”Watch the epic takedown of Rep.

Many of the “families” are actually NOT families, and border patrol has to vet them so they can protect the children:“We didn’t see this in the past, now we have men of the household traveling with a child, sometimes it is their child, but sometimes it isn’t,” said Agent Carmen Qualia, Acting Executive Officer for the Rio Grande Valley Sector.Our immigration policy is incentivizing trafficking of small children.  According to the border patrol, single-family units crossing have increased by 200% (see our previous report below). That tells immigration experts that something isn’t right.This is one of the loopholes that Congress needs to close, but Democrats are more interested in keeping the flow of illegals coming.

One local news reporter has done an incredible job of bringing us shocking video of the crisis. Sydney Hernandez is a gem of a reporter who just visited a processing center to report back to America:McAllen, Texas Central Processing Center is one of many processing. centers that take illegals after they’ve been apprehended by Border Patrol agents. This is a stopping off point for 72 hours so they can be ‘processed.’CAPACITY!Local reporter Sydney Hernandez of Valley Central was given a tour of the Central Processing Center, CPC,  where there are 2,400 illegals being held. They are at “capacity” according to Hernandez who has been bravely reporting from the border providing coverage that our mainstream media doesn’t.ALARMING RISE IN “FAMILY UNITS:The Border Patrol told Hernandez that said they are seeing an over 200% increase in family units.There is evidence that innocent children are being used as pawns to cross the border. Because a family unit has a better chance of avoiding detention, children are being used by men to get through:They request asylum at the border, and they know that they are unlikely to remain detained if they travel with a child. They also have a better shot at fending off deportation when they come with a child.Our current law states that the government can only keep family units in the processing center for 72 hours. They are either transferred to a detention facility suitable for children, or they are released. Because of the overflow, THOUSANDS OF DETAINED ILLEGALS ARE BEING RELEASED TO GO FREE EACH WEEK!“We didn’t see this in the past, now we have men of the household traveling with a child, sometimes it is their child, but sometimes it isn’t,” said Agent Carmen Qualia, Acting Executive Officer for the Rio Grande Valley Sector.#BORDERNEWS This morning, I was allowed rare access inside the McAllen Central Processing Center.

At this one processing center alone, they need double the money this year. Multiply that by all of the other processing centers, and it’s a huge price tag for the illegal alien processing.The budget for the processing center is $12.5 million, but Agent Qualia said they have already reached that point and have asked for another $12.5 million to continue running it.For the last 12 days, agents in the RGV have apprehended more than 1,000 people every day.Tuesday alone, 1,2501 were apprehended.This group is just another liberal group who also is calling for others like John Kelly to be blacklisted from jobs.

81,04-Apr-19,"File this story under, “What the heck did you just say?”A 53-year-old North Carolina man has found himself in hot water after it was discovered that he was not properly caring for his 6-inch pet Oscar fish. Local authorities are coming down hard on the North Carolina man, charging him with three counts of misdemeanor cruelty to animals and one count of abandonment of an animal.Lt. Jerry Brewer says it’s the county’s first animal cruelty case involving a pet fish, but this “is a life like any dog or cat.”According to the Charlotte Observer – The 53-year-old abandoned the fish after he was evicted from his New Hanover County home March 22, according to WECT. When the Oscar fish was found by deputies March 25, it was “was in poor health and swimming in a dirty tank,” the TV station reported.“It came in with a disease, hole in the head, which is a parasite that is caused by poor water quality and malnutrition,” Lane told The State. “It was a pretty severe case of the disease, which opens sores and lesions on the fish’s head. It is an infection that can be fatal.”The fish is being treated with medicine and a healthy diet, something it was not accustomed to, Lane said.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]A spokesman for the New Hanover County Sheriff’s Office said this is the first time his office has charged a person with animal cruelty toward a fish, WECT reported. But the county will not stand for abuse of any animal.“If you harm or neglect an animal in New Hanover County, we are coming for you,” Lt. Jerry Brewer said, according to the TV station.Hinson was charged with three counts of misdemeanor cruelty to animals and one count of abandonment of an animal, WRAL reported.The Oscar fish won’t be returned to Hinson, but its final destination has not been determined.While it might be put up for adoption, the unnamed fish might also take up permanent residence at The Fish Room, where it would serve as a store mascot, according to Lane. He also said they might set up a tank for the fish at the sheriff’s office since “they saved him.”Over the years, we’ve witnessed an untold number of goldfish floating to the top of the tank, after dying while in the care of our young daughters. Who would’ve thought we’d have to worry about one of them ending up behind bars?What do you think? Have the authorities crossed the line with the arrest of this 53-year-old man?

82,04-Apr-19,"In May of 2018, President Trump was slammed by the media and by Democrat Party leaders like Nancy Pelosi for referring to MS-13 gang members as “animals.” Trump made no mistake about his commitment to take down the world’s most violent international gang.If Democrats in Congress refuse to secure our borders or take the massive influx of illegal aliens into our country seriously, there will be no way to stop this violent gang from multiplying in cities across America.40-year-old William Umberto Martinez Chavez, an MS-13 animal who was deported in 2017 for the fatal stabbing of a man on New York’s Long Island has been arrested again, in the same town where he committed his violent crime that put him in jail the last time he snuck into the United States.According to Fox News – William Umberto Martinez Chavez, 40, was arrested in Huntington, New York on Tuesday morning by agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The 40-year-old, who still has MS-13 tattoos on his chest and stomach, was deported in October 2017 after being convicted of manslaughter and serving time in state prison in connection with a fatal stabbing in May 2000 outside a deli in Huntington, according to federal prosecutors.Watch the latest video at &amp;amp;lt;a href=”https://www.foxnews.com”&amp;amp;gt;foxnews.com&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;Officials said Chavez has been charged with illegal reentry into the U.S., and faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted.“Martinez Chavez is a known MS-13 gang member who was convicted of manslaughter, served his time and was removed from the United States, only to resurface on the same streets after having entered illegally,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations New York Field Office Director Thomas Decker said. “It is the job of the brave men and women of ICE to take those who break the laws of this country off the streets and see that they are removed back to their home countries.”In October 2018, it was revealed by the New York Post, that Long Island residents, who’ve been terrorized by MS-13 gang members for years, are building panic rooms to keep them safe in their homes from these illegal alien monsters.There is a specter haunting the Hamptons — one that’s turning some of the priciest properties in the country into fortresses equipped with bulletproof glass, weaponry and panic rooms.“I sleep with a gun underneath my pillow: a Walther PPK/S, the same one James Bond carried,” said John Catsimatidis, owner of Red Apple Group and Gristedes Foods, who has a vacation property in East Quogue. “[My wife] Margo prefers a shotgun. Although, once, she thought she heard something, got the shotgun out and shot through the door.”The billionaire and his family, like others in the Hamptons, are shaken up over concerns that the vicious Salvadorian gang MS-13 is too close for comfort. In April, members of the gang massacred four young men behind a soccer field in Central Islip. Three months later, a Hampton Bays brothel raided by police was found to be tagged with an MS-13 sign. And in 2016, a man with MS-13 connections broke into a Southampton home and sexually assaulted a woman.Last year, Southampton Town Police Chief Steven Skrynecki publicly expressed concern that the gang might spread further east. When he deployed police equipped with antiterrorism gear, including automatic weapons, along the perimeters of summer 2017 charity galas, locals took note.One Southampton homeowner, who requested to remain anonymous for security reasons, recently outfitted her East End manse with bulletproof glass and hidden cameras throughout.“[MS-13 is] in Suffolk County,” she said. “What’s an hour car ride? They are near.”",fake
83,03-Apr-19,"TROUBLE IN SOCIALIST PARADISE? Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just been hit with another Federal Election Commission complaint of a ‘subsidy scheme’.It’s alleged that her campaign manager was in on the scheme too.The FEC just accused Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her campaign manager, Saikat Chakrabarti, of overseeing several PACs (political action committees) that allowed them to raise more money than is legal.According to Fox News, an LLC (limited liability company) was created “in order to avoid federal expenditure requirements”. The LLC connected to Ocasio-Cortez and her campaign manager is guilty of providing campaign contributions known as “in-kind” expenditures by only charging candidates for a portion of the total cost of the service. This is a problem because “goods and services provided by political campaigns must be paid for at market value”.This is the second FEC complaint to hit Ocasio-Cortez. The questions and concerns are that they moved money around and have no record of expenditures for the money. It’s alleged that they transferred a large amount of money from PACs to several LLCs in an “off-the-books operation”:The National Legal and Policy Center filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission accusing the Democratic lawmaker and her chief of staff of being part of an “off-the-books operation” to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on candidates last year.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The FEC complaint asserts that Chakrabarti established two PACs, the Brand New Congress PAC and Justice Democrats PAC, and then systematically transferred more than $885,000 in contributions received by those PACs to the Brand New Campaign LLC and the Brand New Congress LLC — companies that, unlike PACs, are exempt from reporting all of their significant expenditures. The PACs claimed the payments were for “strategic consulting.”THIS “TAX THE RICH” SOCIALIST ALSO OWES BACK TAXES:Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to jack up taxes for everyone, but she can’t even pay her own tax bill!As it turns out a company founded by Ocasio-Cortez still owes corporate taxes of $1,870.“The company probably got numerous letters from the state and probably ignored them.” – A New York City accountant’s theorySo Ocasio-Cortez can skip on her taxes, but she expects everyone else to pay more? Sounds like a case of “do as I say and not as I do.”She has previously called for a 70 percent tax on anyone making over 10 million to finance her ‘Green New Deal.’ She also just signed on to a bill that would tax stock trades.This is a classic case of Socialism where the politicians have one set of rules and the masses have another.The New York Post reported on the company founded by Ocasio-Cortez that produced nothing:Brook Avenue Press was set up to “develop and identify stories and literature in urban areas like New York, specifically communities like The Bronx,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a YouTube video (see below) posted on October 2011, months before she filed incorporation papers for the company in July 2012.The company relied on cheap office space in a city-subsidized program to help small businesses in The Bronx.Called the Sunshine Bronx Business Incubator, the program was housed in a renovated former printing plant in Hunts Point, where rates for office spaces and tech services in 2012 averaged between $99 for a “virtual office” and $275 per month for local start-ups.“You see a huge return on your investment here,” a 22-year-old Ocasio-Cortez told a reporter in July 2012. “People pay $500 an hour for consulting that we get for free by the water cooler.”Her photo is still on the Sunshine Bronx Business Incubator website:But despite her promise to work with “designers, artists, and authors that really know the urban story and help develop stories for kids,” The Post could not find any books the publishing house produced.It sounds like Ocasio-Cortez was working the system and then never produced a thing!In the meantime, Ocasio-Cortez is possibly in deeper trouble with the FEC:“IT’S NOT DARK MONEY BUT MORE LIKE BLACK MONEY”Sounds like another case of the rules applying to everyone BUT Ocasio-Cortez.  ",fake
84,02-Apr-19,"While top Democrats like Nancy Pelosi are defending Joe Biden from accusations of “inappropriate touching”, the situation just  gets worse:The New York Times is reporting that two more women have come forward to say they experienced unwanted touching from former Vice President Joe Biden.They say they were made uncomfortable by encounters with Biden:Caitlyn Caruso is a 22-year-old college student and the second accuser is a 59-year-old writer named D.J. Hill.Ms. Caruso told the Times that Biden put his hand on her thigh, despite her squirming back at him. The ironic thing is that Ms. Caruso was speaking about her story of sexual assault at an event on sexual assault! It’s hard to imagine what this survivor of sexual assault had to go through with repeated unwanted touching from Biden:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]At the encounter three years ago at an event on sexual assault at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, Mr. Biden also hugged Ms. Caruso “just a little bit too long.”While Ms. Caruso said she said nothing publicly and just considered the encounter how men are, she felt, the Times wrote “particularly uncomfortable because she had just shared her own story of sexual assault and had expected Mr. Biden — an architect of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act — to understand the importance of physical boundaries.”
“It doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that,” Ms. Caruso told the Times. “These are supposed to be people you can trust.”Ms. D. J. Hill and her husband Robert were having their pictures taken with Biden at a 2012 fundraiser in Minneapolis when he began to get so handsy with her that Hill’s husband had to intervene:Mr. Biden put his arm around Ms. Hill’s shoulder and then began moving it down her back making her “very uncomfortable,” she told the Times.Mr. Hill saw her reaction and then put his arm on Mr. Biden’s shoulder and made a joke to interrupt. According toMs. Hill, she also said nothing then and didn’t know Mr. Biden’s intent or even whether he sensed any awkwardness from the Hills.“Only he knows his intent,” Ms. Hill said, but “if something makes you feel uncomfortable, you have to feel able to say it.”LUCY FLORES TELLS HER STORY:Lucy Flores writes a stunning description of her first-hand experience with former Vice President Biden in which she claims he groped and kissed her.The description of what happened to Flores sounds exactly like what you see happening in the many photos we’ve all seen of Biden creeping on women. Young or old, it really doesn’t matter.Biden has a way of invading the space of so many women who look exactly how Flores described her experience: Mortified!Flores describes the encounter in New York Magazine’s ‘The Cut’She’s a Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Nevada looking for some help just three days before the election in 2014. She was ‘grateful and flattered’ to have VP Joe Biden offer to make an appearance at a campaign rally along with Eva Longoria.Just as you would imagine these types of encounters in the many pictures happened, this is what happened to Flores:I found my way to the holding room for the speakers, where everyone was chatting, taking photos, and getting ready to speak to the hundreds of voters in the audience. Just before the speeches, we were ushered to the side of the stage where we were lined up by order of introduction. As I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd, I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. “Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?”I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragametierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.Flores describes her shock and feeling about what just happened. She describes her sudden feeling of being disrespected by Biden and how this would be different if it had been the real working world. Flores says she would have complained to the HR department but where do you complain on the campaign trail? The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family, or romantic partners — and I felt powerless to do anything about it. In politics, you shrug it off, smile for the cameras, and get back to the task of trying to win your race.Flores says she moved on with her life until pictures started to surface of Biden groping other women. She says that had she never seen those photos, she wouldn’t have spoken out.Had I never seen those pictures, I may have been able to give Biden the benefit of the doubt. Had there not been multiple articles written over the years about the exact same thing — calling his creepy behavior an “open secret” — perhaps it would feel less offensive.She says she was fearful of speaking out but hearing of Biden’s potential candidacy, she decided to speak up to tell her story.Waiting for the #MeToo movement to address this repeat offender.",fake

Keep singing!CNN ANCHOR ANDERSON COOPER: The 2017 assessment that the President says he now agrees with, that was done while you and then NCI Director John Brennan were still in office.

Bush, asked on Fox News, “What role did Barack Obama have, did he know that the FBI was keeping informants there, and I’ll guarantee the answer is yes.” He continued to say that the FBI must have gone through the White House first before putting an FBI informant in a presidential campaign. –Daily CallerOn Tuesday, Clapper appeared on The View, where he was treated like royalty by the Trump hating panel.Real Clear Politics – While discussing the Trump campaign surveillance scandal in an appearance on Tuesday’s The View, Clapper used the word spy. Clapper said the spy was there for Russian meddling purposes and that Trump should be happy such a person existed.Clapper also claimed Trump should be happy the FBI was spying on him.President Trump has claimed for months now that his campaign for president was surveilled. Many did not take him seriously, however, last night law professor Jonathan Turley said he was right.“With the informant business, well, the point here is the Russians,” Clapper said. “Not spying on the campaign but what are the Russians doing? And in a sense, unfortunately, what they were trying to do is protect our political system and protect the campaign.”“But the FBI started to look into Trump’s ties to Russia in the summer of 2016. Trump tweeted that this spring — this spying, rather, this spying that he claims is spying, other people say it’s a whistleblower or informant. He says it’s spying, it’s bigger than Watergate. So I ask you, was the FBI spying on Trump’s campaign?” Co-host Joy Behar asked.“No, they were not,” Clapper answered. “They were spying on, a term I don’t particularly like, but on what the Russians were doing. Trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating, trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage or influence which is what they do.”“Well, why doesn’t like that? He should be happy,” Behar said.“He should be,” Clapper responded. “Right,” Behar said.Watch:Conservative former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who is never one to hold back on his opinion, had plenty to say about Clapper’s attempt to convince Americans that former President Barack Obama had no knowledge of the spy that was planted in his campaign.Clarke tweeted:Clapper is a straight up LIAR.

Families, along with unaccompanied children, accounted for 60 percent of all apprehensions since Oct. 1.“We are currently facing both a border security and humanitarian crisis along our southwest border,” Kevin McAleenan, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner,  told reporters.During the five-month period ended Feb. 28, Border Patrol officers apprehended some 268,000 migrants who entered the United States without legal authorization.

The countries affected make up the so-called “Northern Triangle” and account for the majority of Central American migrants who are crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.The State Department began informing Congress of the decision on Friday.“At the Secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the President’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process,” a spokesperson for the State Department said in a statement.Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday, “I’ve ended payments to Guatemala, to Honduras, and to El Salvador. No money goes there anymore.” He has threatened to cut off aid in the past, including in an October tweet.",fake

91,29-Mar-19,"Lucy Flores, a former member of Bernie Sanders’ political group, “Our Revolution,” dropped a bombshell today when she describes a creepy encounter she had with him in New York Magazine’s ‘The Cut’If Joe Biden didn’t have a well-recorded history of touching and caressing young girls and women, Democrats might suspect the presidential campaign of Socialist Bernie Sanders was behind Flores’ accusations. Coincidentally, only yesterday, a new poll came out showing Joe Biden, who has not yet announced his candidacy, taking a substantial lead over Sanders and equally creepy Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke in the Democrat presidential primary race.In 2014, Flores was a Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Nevada looking for some help just three days before the election. She was ‘grateful and flattered’ to have VP Joe Biden offer to make an appearance at a campaign rally along with Eva Longoria.Flores can be seen in the photo below with VP Joe Biden as he wraps his hand around Eva Longoria’s back and directly under her breast.I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself, “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also, what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying, “tragametierra,” it means, “earth, swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.Flores describes her shock and feeling about what just happened. She describes her sudden feeling of being disrespected by Biden and how this would be different if it had been the real working world. Flores says she would have complained to the HR department but where do you complain on the campaign trail?The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends, family, or romantic partners — and I felt powerless to do anything about it. In politics, you shrug it off, smile for the cameras, and get back to the task of trying to win your race.Flores says she moved on with her life until pictures started to surface of Biden groping other women. She says that had she never seen those photos, she wouldn’t have spoken out.Had I never seen those pictures, I may have been able to give Biden the benefit of the doubt. Had there not been multiple articles written over the years about the exact same thing — calling his creepy behavior an “open secret” — perhaps it would feel less offensive.According to NPR – Flores says she remained quiet for years, “fear[ing] my experience would be dismissed… But hearing Biden’s potential candidacy for president discussed without much talk about his troubling past as it relates to women became too much to keep bottled up any longer.” During her 2016 Democratic primary campaign for Congress, Flores was endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is again seeking the Democratic nomination for president.Flores writes that she “spoke to a male friend who is also a political operative in Biden’s orbit,” and that he made her question her actions and recollection of the event, and reminded her about Biden’s “significant resources,” suggesting that her credibility would be attacked if she came forward.She says she was fearful of speaking out but hearing of Biden’s potential candidacy, she decided to speak up to tell her story.Biden spokesman Bill Russo said in a statement that the former vice president “was pleased” to support Flores and hold the event for her. “Neither then, nor in the years since, did he or the staff with him at the time have an inkling that Ms. Flores had been at any time uncomfortable, nor do they recall what she describes,” Russo said.“But Vice President Biden believes that Ms. Flores has every right to share her own recollection and reflections, and that it is a change for better in our society that she has the opportunity to do so,” Russo continued. “He respects Ms. Flores as a strong and independent voice in our politics and wishes her only the best.”Just this week, Biden spoke at the “Biden Courage Awards,” an event for It’s On Us, an organization started under the Obama White House to combat campus sexual assault.",fake

Act, which would ban most abortions after six weeks, or when an unborn baby’s heartbeat is first detected, was passed by the Georgia Senate on Friday.Actress Alyssa Milano immediately took to Twitter, saying: “There are over 20 productions shooting in GA & the state just voted to strip women of their bodily autonomy. Hollywood! We should stop feeding GA economy. #HB481IsBadForBusiness.”Now, more than 40 celebrities have signed her open letter sent to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and House Speaker David Ralston, saying they will urge TV and film production companies to abandon the state if the bill is signed into law. The list includes household names such as Ben Stiller, Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, and Mia Farrow.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]In a blatant attempt to use their economic power to sway the democratic process, they say that they’ve “been glad to bring billions of dollars in revenue to support Georgia’s schools, parks and communities” but that “we cannot in good conscience recommend that our industry remain in Georgia if HB481 becomes law.”Their letter declares: “This dangerous and deeply-flawed bill mimics many others which have already been deemed unconstitutional. As men who identify as small-government conservatives, we remind you that government is never bigger than when it is inside a woman’s body or in her doctor’s office.”The letter then becomes even more threatening and describes this attempt to save even some unborn lives as “evil”.“We can’t imagine being elected officials who had to say to their constituents, ‘I enacted a law that was so evil, it chased billions of dollars out of our state’s economy.’ It’s not the most effective campaign slogan, but rest assured we’ll make it yours should it come to pass.”Governor Kemp is not giving in to the threats, saying: “I do not think it will hurt the film industry in Georgia or any other business whatsoever. Us sticking up for our Georgia values and protecting life is not going to create a bad business environment in Georgia, I can promise you.”Democrats…the party of killing babies, Socialism, and open borders.

96,27-Mar-19,"Protesters outside the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington compared Israel supporters to Nazis in a demonstration organized by Al-Awda, an anti-Israel group with connections to several Palestinian terrorist organizations.Abbas Hamideh, who was a special guest of U.S. Congresswoman Rashida-Tlaib at her swearing-in ceremony, was leading the protest.Earlier this month, The Jerusalem Post exposed Al-Awda’s ties to terrorist groups. It is a founding member of the Global Palestinian Right of Return Coalition (GPRRC), part of the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), which coordinates the anti-Israel boycott, divestment and sanctions movement worldwide. The central organization in the BNC is the Palestinian National and Islamic Forces (PNIF), which includes five US-designated terrorist organizations: Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the Popular Front-General Command, the Palestine Liberation Front and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
“A progressive Zionist is the same as a progressive Nazi,” Abbas Hamideh, an Al-Awda leader, chanted at Sunday’s protest, with demonstrators cheering him in response. Hamideh posted a video of the protest on his Facebook page.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Facebook clips show Al-Awda leader Abbas Hamideh protesting outside AIPAC conference in Washington on March 25, 2019.

Ilhan Omar, which was condemned as antisemitic by many Jewish organizations and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, Hamideh said: “We are demanding an end to AIPAC’s influence over our American politicians. We demand an end to the Benjamins” – meaning $100 bills – “that go to the politicians.”Al-Awda, which is Arabic for “the return,” calls on its website for an end to all US aid to Israel, a comprehensive boycott of Israel, the “right of return” for Palestinian refugees and their descendants, and a Palestinian state “in all of Palestine,” meaning one that would replace Israel. It refers to Israel in quotation marks, further signaling its refusal to accept the country’s existence.In his Facebook post, Hamideh brags about shooting down the Secret Service for allegedly asking him if he had a permit to protest in front of the White House.Abbas Hamideh Secret Service: “Do you have a permit for this rally?” Me: “You ask the same question every year. No, we don’t need one it’s the White House, did they change the constitution?” Secret Service: “No.” Me: “OK.” ????The bigger question is, why would the Secret Service allow a man with ties to terror groups protest in front of the White House?

97,26-Mar-19,"Yesterday, New York Post op-ed editor Sohrab Ahmaria published a hilarious take on the NCAA Basketball March Madness bracket. Instead of college teams, the bracket included some of President Trump’s most public and shameless haters. The list is obviously too long to include in one chart, but Ahmaria does a solid job of representing some of the most unhinged Democrats. From CNN and MSNBC hosts to mainstream media “journalists,” and late-night hosts, the list also features some of the most unhinged celebrities, “never-Trumpers” and daytime talk show hosts hacks, like The View’s Joy Behar.From the New York Post – Special counsel Robert Mueller has definitively put to rest the collusion theory of President Trump’s election. That’s not a little embarrassing for the many journalists, talking heads, celebrities and instant experts who spent more than two years furiously speculating about Moscow “pee-pee” tapes, treasonous rendezvous and the president’s imminent arrest.The president’s haters no doubt wish to memory-hole collusion and move on to the next anti-Trump theory. But not so fast: We want to laurel the punditry “champion” — the one who peddled the most nonsensical nonsense, the wildest inanities, the weirdest theories, and unsubstantiated stories.That’s where your brackets come in.Our contenders are divided into four groups (not unlike NCAA conferences): the print journalists, the cable TV talkers, the Twitterati, and the network news reporters and “analysts.” And the brackets are seeded, with the most visible and influential figures contending against the lesser-known.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]In the Print category, the top seed is the never-Trump honcho Bill Kristol, who in August predicted that “Mueller will find there was collusion between Trump associates and Putin operatives; that Trump knew about it; and that Trump sought to cover it up and obstruct its investigation.” Or not.“Pick your brackets,” Ahmaria tells his readers, “— no, not for March Madness.

The problem the left will have is that there isn’t sufficient evidence. The left would have to show “corrupt intent”. This leaves the door open for Democrats to try and impeach President Trump on a flimsy obstruction charge.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“The Special Counsel, therefore, did not draw a conclusion – one way or the other – as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as ‘difficult issues’ of law and fact concerning whether the President’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.”FULL TEXT OF BARR’S LETTER BELOW:On Friday, the Special Counsel submitted to me a “confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions” he has reached, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 600.8(c). This report is entitled “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.” Although my review is ongoing, I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation.The report explains that the Special Counsel and his staff thoroughly investigated allegations that members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, and others associated with it, conspired with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, or sought to obstruct the related federal investigations. In the report, the Special Counsel noted that, in completing his investigation, he employed 19 lawyers who were assisted by a team of approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, and other professional staff. The Special Counsel issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers, made 13 requests to foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses.The Special Counsel obtained a number of indictments and convictions of individuals and entities in connection with his investigation, all of which have been publicly disclosed. During the course of his investigation, the Special Counsel also referred several matters to other offices for further action. The report does not recommend any further indictments, nor did the Special Counsel obtain any sealed indictments that have yet to be made public. Below, I summarize the principal conclusions set out in the Special Counsel’s report.Russian Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The Special Counsel’s report is divided into two parts. The first describes the results of the Special Counsel’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The report outlines the Russian effort to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government in connection with those efforts. The report further explains that a primary consideration for the Special Counsel’s investigation was whether any Americans – including individuals associated with the Trump campaign – joined the Russian conspiracies to influence the election, which would be a federal crime. The Special Counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As the report states: “[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”The Special Counsel’s investigation determined that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election. The first involved attempts by a Russian organization, the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to conduct disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election. As noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that any U.S. person or Trump campaign official or associate conspired or knowingly coordinated with the IRA in its efforts, although the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian nationals and entities in connection with these activities.The second element involved the Russian government’s efforts to conduct computer hacking operations designed to gather and disseminate information to influence the election. The Special Counsel found that Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. Based on these activities, the Special Counsel brought criminal charges against a number of Russian military officers for conspiring to hack into computers in the United States for purposes of influencing the election. But as noted above, the Special Counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple. offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.Obstruction of Justice. The report’s second part addresses a number of actions by the President – most of which have been the subject of public reporting – that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns. After making a “thorough factual investigation” into these matters, the Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment. The Special Counsel, therefore, did not draw a conclusion – one way or the other – as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. Instead, for each of the relevant actions investigated, the report sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as “difficult issues” of law and fact concerning whether the President’s actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction. The Special Counsel states that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”The Special Counsel’s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime. Over the course of the investigation, the Special Counsel’s office engaged in discussions with certain Department officials regarding many of the legal and factual matters at issue in the Special Counsel’s obstruction investigation. After reviewing the Special Counsel’s final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.In making this determination, we noted that the Special Counsel recognized that “the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference,” and that, while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the President’s intent with respect to obstruction. Generally speaking, to obtain and sustain an obstruction conviction, the government would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person, acting with corrupt intent, engaged in obstructive conduct with a sufficient nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding. In cataloguing the President’s actions, many of which took place in public view, the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct, had a nexus to a pending or contemplated proceeding, and were done with corrupt intent, each of which, under the Department’s principles of federal prosecution guiding charging decisions, would need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to establish an obstruction-of­-justice offense.Status of the Department’s Review The relevant regulations contemplate that the Special Counsel’s report will be a “confidential report” to the Attorney General. See Office of Special Counsel, 64 Fed. Reg. 37,038, 37,040-41 (July 9, 1999). As I have previously stated, however, I am mindful of the public interest in this matter. For that reason, my goal and intent is to release as much of the Special Counsel’s report as I can consistent with applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies.Based on my discussions with the Special Counsel and my initial review, it is apparent that the report contains material that is or could be subject to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6( e ), which imposes restrictions on the use and disclosure of information relating to “matter[ s] occurring before [a] grand jury.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(2)(B). Rule 6(e) generally limits disclosure of certain grand jury information in a criminal investigation and prosecution. Id. Disclosure of 6( e) material beyond the strict limits set forth in the rule is a crime in certain circumstances. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 401(3). This restriction protects the integrity of grand jury proceedings and ensures that the unique and invaluable investigative powers of a grand jury are used strictly for their intended criminal justice function.Given these restrictions, the schedule for processing the report depends in part on how quickly the Department can identify the 6( e) material that by law cannot be made public. I have requested the assistance of the Special Counsel in identifying all 6( e) information contained in the report as quickly as possible. Separately, I also must identify any information that could impact other ongoing matters, including those that the Special Counsel has referred to other offices. As soon as that process is complete, I will be in a position to move forward expeditiously in determining what can be released in light of applicable law, regulations, and Departmental policies.As I observed in my initial notification, the Special Counsel regulations provide that “the Attorney General may determine that public release of’ notifications to your respective Committees “would be in the public interest.” 28 C.F.R. § 600.9(c). I have so determined, and I will disclose this letter to the public after delivering it to you.Sincerely,
William P. Barr Attorney General",fake

104,22-Mar-19,"Another person tied to the Clinton’s has been found dead. Alan Krueger, a  58-year-old labor economist who argued for raising the mininum wage, is said to have committed suicide—a popular choice of death for anyone with ties to the Clintons. According to reports, the Princeton police were called to the professor’s home, where he was found dead of an apparent suicide.According to the New York Times – Mr. Krueger was an assistant secretary of the Treasury from 2009 to 2010, as President Barack Obama’s administration tried to lead the United States out of its worst recession since the Great Depression. Mr. Obama later named him chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, a post he held from 2011 to 2013. He was the Labor Department’s chief economist under President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 1995.Mr. Krueger was perhaps best known for his work in the early 1990s on the effects of the minimum wage, in collaboration with Mr. Katz and another economist, David Card. Standard economic thinking at the time held that raising the minimum wage would reduce employment for low-wage workers; Mr. Katz said that he and Mr. Krueger had expected to find the same. Instead, they discovered no impact on employment — a finding that has proved influential though it remains in dispute.A labor economist by training, Mr. Krueger was part of a new wave of economists who pushed the field toward a more empirical mind-set, with an emphasis on data rather than theory. He applied that approach broadly: to education, health care, labor markets and terrorism, and even to more lighthearted subjects like the rising price of concert tickets. His latest book, due out in June, is on the economics of the music industry.Krueger’s soon to be released book can be ordered here.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Actress Robbin Young, who is also a friend of Wikileaks’ Julian Assange, asks why Alan Krueger would commit suicide only months before the release of his new book in June of 2019?That’s a great question.????

105,22-Mar-19,"Twelve Republican Senators went against President Trump recently when they voted against his border emergency. While Democrats are always team players, it hasn’t been the case with Republicans. Between the never-Trump group and those who suddenly felt the need to stand against declaring a national emergency (Rand Paul), these twelve Senators really let the American people down.There has been a backlash from the Republican base and the Trump supporters who believe in what the president is doing to protect Americans. Part of the backlash could be felt when these twelve Senators are up for election again. One of these Senators rode on President Trump’s coattails to win in a close race the last election. U.S. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri only won his election by 3 percentage points. The vote against Trump could spell trouble for the Senator next time around.Even though Senator Roy Blunt has been reinvited to the event below, he got the message loud and clear that Americans are not happy with his vote against Trump:The Kansas City Star reports:U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt has been disinvited from a local GOP gathering in Christian County, Missouri, next month amid a backlash over his vote to block President Donald Trump’s use of emergency powers to build a border wall.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“I am so disappointed in you now that I can hardly speak,” wrote Wanda Martens, a member of the Christian County Republican Central Committee, in an email to Blunt’s office. “Why could you not support my president in the emergency declaration? President Trump tried every available means to work the Senate to resolve the border issue and build the much needed wall. He is well within his presidential powers to do this.”“Please don’t try to tell me that I don’t understand. I understand completely,” Martens wrote. “I hate it when someone calls you the establishment and that you are part of the swamp, but maybe they were right.”Wanda didn’t know when she sent the email to Blunt that another committee member had invited Blunt. So Blunt is invited but can’t make it. Wanda did what everyone should do. She spoke up against Blunt for the vote.The Twelve Senators who voted against President Trump might want to think about their next career. Something tells us that there are many more who feel just like Wanda Martens. ",fake
106,21-Mar-19,"“We continue to uncover the mishandling of classified information in Clinton emails that she tried to hide or destroy. Attorney General Barr should immediately order a new investigation of the Hillary Clinton email scandal.” – Tom Fitton, Judicial WatchA newly unearthed batch of heavily redacted, classified emails from Hillary Clinton’s personal email server obtained by Judicial Watch reveal that Clinton discussed establishing a “private, 100% off-the-record” back channel of communication. The emails also show there was close coordination between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation implicating Clinton in “pay-to-play” moves that sold access to the Obama administration.The 756-page group of new documents, revealed Thursday as part of a transparency lawsuit by Judicial Watch, seemingly contradicted Clinton’s insistence under oath in 2015 that she had turned over all of her sensitive work-related emails to the State Department, and included a slew of classified communications on everything from foreign policy to State Department personnel matters:On five occasions Clinton’s secretary, Lauren Jiloty, sent Clinton’s sensitive daily itinerary to her on her unsecure email account.WE WILL BE REPORTING ON MORE FROM THE EMAILS BUT THE DISCUSSION ON ISRAEL IS IMPORTANT:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]BLUMENTHAL AND CLINTON DISCUSS JEWISH SUPPORTERS IN AMERICA:In a bombshell January 2009 email uncovered by Judicial Watch, Blumenthal warned Clinton about taking a tough stance on Israel:“Every one of your conversations and communications with Bibi Netanyahu flows directly and instantly back to top Jewish leadership … You should, of course, assume that nothing involving him is private.”Blumenthal then noted that Bibi is “deeply connected” to the “US-media, Jewish groups, Republican leaders, and right-wing Christian right organizations.”Clinton adviser Lanny Davis in 2010 also offered Hillary another back channel for communication: “private and highly trusted communication line, unofficial and personal, to PM N[etanyahu]. … [N]o one on the planet (other than your wonderful husband) can get this done as well as you…”Davis backed off of following through with this back channel but it is just another example of the slippery politics involved here.Thank goodness Judicial Watch is doing the heavy lifting for everyone else!

107,21-Mar-19,"Yesterday, during his press conference with Brazil president Jair Bolsaonaro in the Rose Garden, President Trump blasted the censorship of conservatives on Facebook and Twitter. When a reporter asked President Trump about censorship of conservatives on the social media platforms, Trump responded: I can tell you, I have many, many, millions of followers on Twitter and it’s different than it used to be. Things are happening, names are taken off, people aren’t getting through you’ve seen the same complaints. And it seems to be if they’re conservative if they’re Republicans, if they’re in a certain group, there’s discrimination and big discrimination. I see it absolutely on Twitter and Facebook, which I have also, but I focus more on Twitter.” We use the word collusion very loosely all the time, and there is collusion with respect to that because something has to be going on. And when you get the back scene, back office statements made by executives of the various companies, and you see the level of, uh, in many cases—hatred they have for a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election. You say that’s really unfair. So, something’s happening with those groups of folks that are running Facebook, and Google and Twitter. And I do think we have to get to the bottom of it. It’s very fair. It’s collusive and it’s very, very fair to say we have to do something about it. And if we don’t, you know, the incredible thing is that we could win an election and we have such a stacked deck. And that includes networks, frankly, when you look at the networks, you look at the news—you look at the newscasts, like all the fake news. Trump continued to call the networks fake news, saying it’s incredible that after all the garbage and fake news conservatives are being fed, it’s amazing that they still pull the lever for Republicans.  He wrapped it up by saying he agrees that they need to look at censorship of conservatives on social media and that they must do something about it.Watch:Trump is claiming that Facebook, Twitter, and Google are colluding against him. https://t.co/Kr9gONd0av pic.twitter.com/LjktF6DL3WTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]— PoliticusUSA (@politicususa) March 19, 2019So, is President Trump correct about Twitter?

112,18-Mar-19,"Almost immediately after President Trump’s inauguration, Facebook traffic on our 100 Percent Fed Up Facebook page began to plummet. Within one year, our traffic had dropped over 90% from the previous year. Meanwhile, on Twitter, the growth of our account has been mostly stagnant for much of the past 18 months. Were the sudden drops in traffic a coincidence or were they coordinated? We have no way of knowing, because both Twitter and Facebook keep their algorithyms hidden from public view, and in doing so, have been able to skirt much of the controversy surrounding the censorship of conservative news sites like ours. The Gateway Pundit, who had a massive influence on the 2016 election, also witnessed a drop of over 90% in traffic from 2017 to 2018. Recently, Jim Hoft, owner of the Gateway Pundit complained about his stagnant nubers on Twitter.Yesterday, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a link to an op-ed he wrote about the censorship of conservatives by tech giants, like Twitter, Facebook and Google. Here’s an excerpt from Trump Jr.’s op-ed in The Hill –As Big Tech’s censorship of conservatives becomes ever more flagrant and overt, the old arguments about protecting the sanctity of the modern public square are now invalid. Our right to freely engage in public discourse through speech is under sustained attack, necessitating a vigorous defense against the major social media and internet platforms. From “shadowbans” on Facebook and Twitter, to demonetization of YouTube videos, to pulled ads for Republican candidates at the critical junctures of election campaigns, the list of violations against the online practices and speech of conservatives is long.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]I certainly had my suspicions confirmed when Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, “accidentally” censored a post I made regarding the Jussie Smollett hoax, which consequently led to me hearing from hundreds of my followers about how they’ve been having problems seeing, liking or being able to interact with my posts. Many of them even claimed that they’ve had to repeatedly refollow me, as Instagram keeps unfollowing me on their accounts.While nothing about Big Tech’s censorship of conservatives truly surprises me anymore, it’s still chilling to see the proof for yourself. If it can happen to me, the son of the president, with millions of followers on social media, just think about how bad it must be for conservatives with smaller followings and those who don’t have the soapbox or media reach to push back when they’re being targeted?Thanks to a brave Facebook whistleblower who approached James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas, we now know that Mark Zuckerberg’s social media giant developed algorithms to “deboost” certain content, limiting its distribution and appearance in news feeds. As you probably guessed, this stealth censorship was specifically aimed at conservatives.The Hill reports – House Intelligence Committee ranking member and former chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is suing Twitter and a number of its users for more than $250 million.The lawsuit filed Monday alleges the social media giant censored conservative voices by “shadow banning” figures, which Nunes says potentially impacted the 2018 midterm election results. Others named in the lawsuit include GOP operative Liz Mair, Mair Strategies, “Devin Nunes’ Mom” (@DevinNunesMom) and “Devin Nunes’ cow” (@DevinCow), two parody accounts that mocked the Trump ally and California Republican.Fox News reports – The lawsuit alleged defamation, conspiracy, and negligence, and sought not only damages, but also an injunction compelling Twitter to turn over the identities behind numerous accounts he said harassed and defamed him. The lawsuit is separate from Nunes’ work on the House Intelligence Committee, where he is now the ranking member.“Twitter is a machine,” Nunes’ personal attorney, Steven S. Biss, told Fox News. “It is a modern-day Tammany Hall. Congressman Nunes intends to hold Twitter fully accountable for its abusive behavior and misconduct.”Although federal law ordinarily exempts services like Twitter from defamation liability at all levels, Nunes’ suit said the platform has taken such an active role in curating and banning content — as opposed to merely hosting it — that it should face liability like any other organization that defames.“Twitter created and developed the content at issue in this case by transforming false accusations of criminal conduct, imputed wrongdoing, dishonesty and lack of integrity into a publicly available commodity used by unscrupulous political operatives and their donor/clients as a weapon,” Nunes’ legal team wrote. “Twitter is ‘responsible’ for the development of offensive content on its platform because it in some way specifically encourages development of what is offensive about the content.”Watch:Nunes accuses Twitter of “facilitating defamation on its platform” by “ignoring lawful complaints about offensive content and by allowing that content to remain accessible to the public” despite alleged violations of its terms of service and rules.“Twitter, by its actions, intended to generate and proliferate the false and defamatory statements about Plaintiff in order to influence the outcome of the 2018 Congressional election and to intimidate Plaintiff and interfere with his important investigation of corruption by the Clinton campaign and alleged Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential Election,” the lawsuit reads.The suit alleges Mair “relentlessly smeared and defamed” the California Republican in citing allegedly false reports accusing him of being involved with a winery embattled with a scandal involving the solicitation of underage prostitutes and cocaine. Nunes has strongly denied the accusations in the report.The lawsuit also accuses the social media platform of failing to remove “libelous” statements made about Nunes posted by Twitter handles @DevinNunesMom and @DevinCow.“Defendant, Devin Nunes’ Mom, is a person who, with Twitter’s consent, hijacked Nunes’ name, falsely impersonated Nunes’ mother, and created and maintained an account on Twitter (@DevinNunesMom) for the sole purpose of attacking, defaming, disparaging and demeaning Nunes,” it states.  ",fake

She regularly tweets on behalf of Planned Parenthood.https://twitter.com/FelicityHuffman/status/1103685913329061889Could Huffman’s passionate advocacy for aborting other people’s babies have anything to do with eliminating the competition for her kids getting into top colleges?Huffman also tweets about issues like gender equality.https://twitter.com/FelicityHuffman/status/1104078995274887168Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]As it turns out, Hollywood hypocrite, Felicity Huffman is not really about equal rights at all. Like most celebrities, she doesn’t really believe what she tweets, it just looks good to her fellow Hollywood hypocrites on her Twitter feed. Huffman is actually all about putting her kids ahead of everyone else, even if it means kicking other more qualified kids to the back of the line.ESPN reports – The FBI and federal prosecutors have uncovered a massive bribery scheme to get students admitted to elite universities as recruited athletes and help them cheat on college entrance exams to gain admission.The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston said the scheme includes 50 people, including college coaches, actresses and CEOs, who collectively paid $25 million to get their children into schools such as Georgetown, Stanford, UCLA, Texas, Wake Forest and Yale.The bribes were orchestrated by William “Rick” Singer, a California admissions consultant who is scheduled to plead guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy, prosecutors said.A Sacramento man is at the center of a high-profile college admissions scam for which an indictment was unsealed Tuesday, implicating TV actresses, CEOs and coaches in bribery efforts totaling $25 million to arrange for children to get into top U.S. schools.FBI and federal prosecutors say William Rick Singer, a resident of Sacramento and Newport Beach and the owner of for-profit and nonprofit education groups, led a racketeering conspiracy that involved cheating on standardized tests, according to an indictment filed in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts.Singer, 59, is accused of facilitating cheating on SAT and ACT exams in exchange for monetary bribes, most ranging between $15,000 and $75,000 per test. In some cases, a third party would “secretly take the exams in place of the actual students,” the indictment says.The scam took place between about 2011 through September 2018, the indictment says.The nine coaches and sports administrators indicted were Rudolph “Rudy” Meredith, former Yale women’s soccer coach; Donna Heinel, USC senior associate athletic director; Ali Khosroshahin, former USC women’s soccer coach; Jovan Vavic, USC women’s water polo coach; William Ferguson, Wake Forest volleyball coach; John Vandemoer, Stanford sailing coach; Michael Center, Texas men’s tennis coach; Jorge Salcedo, UCLA men’s soccer coach; and Gordie Ernst, former men’s and women’s tennis coach at Georgetown. Ernst was hired last year to coach women’s tennis at Rhode Island.Both Ferguson and Center have been placed on leave by their schools, while Vandemoer has been fired by Stanford.Meredith, who coached women’s soccer at Yale for 24 years before resigning in November 2018, is accused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and honest services fraud. He is pleading guilty and helped build the case against others.Hollywood actresses Felicity Huffman (“Desperate Housewives”) and Lori Loughlin (“Full House”) were among those who paid bribes to help their children gain admission into the universities, according to the indictment. Huffman and Loughlin are among 13 people taken into custody Tuesday in Los Angeles. Each faces one charge each of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.Parents spent anywhere from $200,000 to $6.5 million to guarantee their children’s admission, officials said. Authorities called it the biggest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Department.",fake
122,12-Mar-19,"Utah’s Never Trump freshman Republican Senator, Mitt Romney got a surprise today when his staff delivered a birthday cake to his office made of Twinkies.  It isn’t clear if Twinkies are a favorite food of the new U.S. Senator, but the “Twinkie” cake does seem fitting for the failed GOP presidential candidate, who couldn’t find his fight his way out of a paper bag during his run for president against Barack Obama in 2012.The awkward Romney stood when his staff entered his office with a birthday cake in hand. “Wow! Just what I’ve always wanted,” the beaming Senator told his laughing staff. Romney approached the cake cautiously, asking, “What are you guys gonna have?” It was what he did next that has the internet buzzing. Romney carefully leaned over the cake, saying, “This is fantastic!” and plucked one candle out of the cake, brought it close to his face and then blew it out. As soon as he blew out the candle, he reached back to the cake and removed one more, blew it out, and returned for another. As he reached for the third candle, he dropped one that appeared to be still lit, saying, “This is never gonna work, is it?” The staff awkwardly laughed.Romney finishes the awkward moment with the everyday people, by telling them he’s glad he hasn’t had breakfast yet.Watch:My team surprised me with a cake made out of my favorite snack—twinkies!

123,11-Mar-19,"The woman whose own daughter describes her as someone who will, “cut your head off, and you won’t even know you’re bleeding,” is now telling her allies at the Washington Post that the clearly divided Democrat Party is all about “unity.” Despite the rallying cries of her radical elements within the Democrat Party to “impeach the motherf**ker,” Nancy Pelosi is attempting to explain why she won’t be looking to impeach the president.During their interview with the Speaker, the Washington Post had some tough discussions with her, like how she’s tried, but already failed at giving up chocolate for Lent. They also discussed how she ate a donut just before receiving her ashes at church on Ash Wednesday. The “devout” Catholic who sits in the Democrat Party’s most powerful position, was never asked, however, about her position on the Democrats recently passed legislation that allows babies to be killed in the mother’s 9th month of pregnancy. They never asked Nancy how she felt about the Democrat Party’s push to allow babies to die unassisted, while they struggle for their last breath after being a victim of a botched abortion. Nancy does, however, explain that despite appearances of a party that is being ripped apart by radical Socialist elements, and members who are putting forth reckless and embarrassing “New Green Deal” proposals, that the party remains “unified.” When Nancy talked about being “unified,” she must have been referring to the issues of “gun control” and the Democrat Party’s desire to flood America with illegal aliens/Democrat voters before the 2020 election, where Democrats are strongly unified.From the Washington Post – Pelosi, 78, never thought that Donald Trump would be elected president, but in many ways, she has been preparing for this political battle all of her life.Now in her fourth decade as an elected representative, Pelosi is at the outset of a term that will almost certainly be the most critical of her career. I spoke with her last week about her relationship with Trump, the rise of a new generation of women lawmakers, the Green New Deal, the prospect of impeachment and more.Is this the most divisive political climate in your 32 years in Congress?Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Yeah, well, it’s very divisive because of the person who is in the White House and the enablers that the Republicans in Congress are to him. It was terrible when we were here in the ’90s and [Newt] Gingrich was Speaker and impeached the president, Bill Clinton. There’s no question that that was horrible for the country. It was unnecessary and the rest. But in terms of where we are, as Thomas Paine said, the times have found us. And the times have found us now. We have a very serious challenge to the Constitution of the United States in the president’s unconstitutional assault on the Constitution, on the first branch of government, the legislative branch. … This is very serious for our country. Forgetting politics, forgetting partisanship, just talk about patriotism. So in terms of divisiveness, that we don’t see a commensurate — I don’t want to say reaction, just action — on the part of Republicans to the statements and actions the president is taking, yeah, this is probably the most divisive and serious. Serious, because again it’s about our fundamentals; it’s not about our politics.For 2020, your goal is to keep control of the House and have a Democrat elected president.And the Senate, the whole thing.Do you feel that he [President Trump] has done anything that has been good for America? He’s been a great organizer for Democrats, a great fundraiser for Democrats and a great mobilizer at the grass-roots level for Democrats. [Laughs.] And I think that’s good for America.There have been increasing calls, including from some of your members, for impeachment of the president.I’m not for impeachment. This is news. I’m going to give you some news right now because I haven’t said this to any press person before. But since you asked, and I’ve been thinking about this: Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he’s just not worth it. So you’re on the cover of Rolling Stone with Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Do you see in this new generation of women lawmakers, not just them, but this generation, do you see yourself in them, or do you not see much of yourself in them at all?Here’s what I see myself in them as: When I came to Congress I had no intention of running for office, shy person that I have always been. I was chair of the [California Democratic] Party, always advancing other people. I loved that because I cared about the causes of the Democratic Party, about fairness in our economy. My motivation is the 1 in 5 children who lives in poverty in America.Is it harder to manage the demands of the more-centrist members who are going to face tougher reelections or the more-progressive members who maybe feel a freedom to push a little more? Understand this: There are a range of views in our caucus, and we respect that. But we are unified. People compliment me and they say, “Oh, you know, you can keep them all together.” I don’t. Our values unify us.It’s Ash Wednesday, and you’re a practicing Catholic. How does your faith guide you in this office?I was born into a family that was devoutly Catholic, fiercely patriotic, proud of our Italian American heritage and staunchly Democrat. And we saw that connection between church and Democrats as the Gospel of Matthew. When I was hungry, when I was thirsty, when I was naked, when I was homeless, when I was in prison. And that was how we were raised, that we had a responsibility to other people. And that was our motivation. So that’s why sometimes it’s hard for me to understand — I have to admit this, that we were raised to say there’s a spark of divinity in every person. That we’re all God’s children. And yet I see people of faith go down paths that so contradict what they say. For example, on the issue of immigration, so many people of faith, I guess they just don’t think that there’s a spark of divinity or that we’re all God’s children. How disrespectful they are.He [President Trump] wants us to spend tens of billions of dollars on a wall that doesn’t serve the purpose and is a sign of discrimination.[Your daughter Alexandra] said in an interview: “She knows what she’s doing. And that should make you sleep at night, knowing that at least somebody in this town knows what they’re doing.” I want to ask: How well do you sleep at night?It depends on how much chocolate I have eaten during the day. Now today I gave up chocolate for lunch — I mean for Lent. [Laughs.] It really was more for lunch because I’m off it already. I had a doughnut for breakfast. I totally forgot till I went to get the ashes that I wasn’t supposed to have that chocolate doughnut for breakfast. Then, once I had the doughnut, I thought I might as well have the chocolate ice cream for lunch. Then my colleague came from Guam and brought chocolate chip cookies. What am I supposed to do? And out of kindness to my colleagues, to my staff and to my families, I don’t think giving up chocolate for Lent is going to work.",fake

125,10-Mar-19,"Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton appeared with Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo to talk about the dirty Democrats and others like Bruce Ohr.  Ohr’s testimony was released and it confirms how closely the Department of Justice and FBI were working with Clinton operative, Christopher Steele.Tom Fitton knows this is an attempt to take down President Trump. He’s doing all of the heavy lifting to investigate the dirty Democrats:HANNITY: BRUCE OHR TESTIMONY RELEASED:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE RELEASE OF THE BRUCE OHR TESTIMONY:The Conservative Treehouse reports – Judicial Watch released documents today, from a previous FOIA request to the DOJ which highlight the extent of the communication between DOJ official Bruce Ohr and the FBI.While there was prior knowledge of the role of Ohr as an FBI intermediary between Fusion-GPS, Chris Steele and the FBI during the original counterintelligence investigation, the new documents show Ohr continued in his role well into Mueller’s appointment.In essence, after the FBI claimed to have broken off formal use of Chris Steele; and long after Robert Mueller took over the investigation; Ohr remained an intermediary between Chris Steele and Robert Mueller’s special counsel team.Obviously, this begs the question: if the special counsel was simply investigating the truth of the dossier, why would Robert Mueller want/need an intermediary as opposed to directly being in contact with, and questioning, the dossier author directly?From Judicial Watch: America’s most important watchdog organization, announced today it received 339 pages of heavily redacted records from the U.S. Department of Justice which reveal that former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr remained in regular contact with former British spy and Fusion GPS contractor Christopher Steele after Steele was terminated by the FBI in November 2016 for revealing to the media his position as an FBI confidential informant.The records show that Ohr served as a go-between for Steele by passing along information to “his colleagues” on matters relating to Steele’s activities. Ohr also set up meetings with Steele, regularly talked to him on the telephone and provided him assistance in dealing with situations Steele was confronted with the media.On Friday, July 29, 2016, Steele emails Bruce Ohr about a meeting that is to include Bruce’s wife Nellie Ohr, who then worked for Fusion GPS, at the Mayflower Hotel:Steele: Dear Bruce,Just to let you know I shall be in DC at short notice on business from this PM till Saturday eve, staying at the Mayflower Hotel.

More useful to all I think, after my scheduled meetings tomorrow. Thanks, ChrisOhr: Chris –Perfect. I’ll see you Friday at your hotel at 8 am. BruceBruce Ohr’s December 8, 2016, phone log shows he called Simpson for a meeting “tomorrow at 3.”Bruce Ohr’s December 13, 2016, phone log shows he spoke with Glenn Simpson the day before and received “some more news.” The log also lists “Rod Rosenstein 5:48 pm.”An exchange beginning December 11, 2016, between Bruce Ohr and Simpson shows them discussing a Daily Beast and a Think Progress article and setting up a phone call between them.The documents obtained by Judicial Watch show a string of encrypted text messages from January to November 2017, well after the FBI had terminated Steele, discussing a possible new point of contact should Ohr leave the FBI; a series of appointments for phone calls; and assurance that Ohr shared information with his “colleagues”:On January 31, 2017, messages are exchanged between Bruce Ohr and Steele regarding fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates:Steele: B, doubtless a sad and crazy day for you re-SY [Sally Yates].

The anti-Trump Russia investigation, now run by Robert Mueller, has been thoroughly compromised by this insider corruption.”Judicial Watch relies on donations by the American public to continue their amazing work. You can DONATE HERE.Judicial Watch earlier released 412 pages of documents about FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) warrants targeting Carter Page, who had been a Trump campaign adviser, which seem to confirm the FBI and DOJ misled the courts in withholding the material information that Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the DNC were behind the “intelligence” used to persuade the courts to approve the FISA warrants that targeted the Trump team.Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, took the unusual step by reading a statement on the House floor and providing a link to the Ohr transcript in the public record. The representative said his patience with the Justice Department “has grown thin.”Ohr served in 2016 and 2017 as a back channel between the FBI and Christopher Steele, the former British spy who authored the anti-Trump dossier alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.Ohr’s wife, Nellie Ohr, worked as a contractor for Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele.“Out of an abundance of caution, we gave DOJ an opportunity to review them for information that would endanger national security, but after many months and little progress, our patience has grown thin,” Collins said.“The proposed redactions have nothing to do with national security and are anathema to our goal of government transparency,” he continued, adding that “I am, therefore, today making one of these transcripts public.”“I intend to make other transcripts public soon,” he said. “I’m willing to consider any reasonable redactions DOJ makes in a timely manner, but won’t allow these transcripts to remain shrouded in secrecy.”Parts of Ohr’s testimony have already been leaked to the press. In the hearing, Ohr undercut several claims made by Glenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS, and California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.Watch Rep.

126,10-Mar-19,"The news that CNN hired a conservative to be the political editor for the 2020 election was a shocker because CNN is historically openly biased towards conservatives. Was CNN pivoting to be more fair and balanced?As it turns out, leftists didn’t care much about being fair and balanced. They didn’t want to know why CNN hired a conservative, they just wanted her gone. Hollywood Reporter even wrote about the “controversial conservative” and how CNN defended the new hire. Still, the DNC and others were not pleased with the move. Hell, the DNC won’t even let Fox News host a presidential primary debate by Democrats!CNN president Jeff Zucker had defended the hire on a Feb. 22 editorial call and asked staffers to keep an open mind. “Let’s not rush to judgment,” he said, according to the network’s Reliable Sources newsletter. “Let’s give everyone a chance.”As expected, social media comments from the left came fast and furious and continue to be really brutal (see below).CNN hired Sarah Isgur Flores in February but after the outrage, they demoted her on International Woman’s Day.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]She just announced via Twitter that she will be a “political analyst” and not a political editor:It’s been a great vacation but I am back on twitter!

Gov. Cuomo’s preliminary budget has $600 million in city cuts in the coming year.But city spending, up some 32 percent since de Blasio took office — triple the rate of inflation — may need to be cut deeper, these analysts add. The city’s long-term pension obligations have escalated, as well, as its workforce has soared by more than 33,000 in the last five years.“New York City could go bankrupt, absolutely,” said Peter C. Earle, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research.",fake

During those years, she cast eight votes authorizing state taxpayer-funded subsidies to corporations and developers, voting “yes” in each instance. Altogether, she voted to authorize transferring $1.031 billion in state tax money to politically favored businesses, with much of the money coming from individuals and small businesses.In her newspaper commentary, Tlaib said the “we cannot continue to subsidize their [corporations’] greed with taxpayer dollars and get nothing in return.”Yet rather than trying to shut down the wealth transfers, as a state representative, Tlaib took every opportunity that came before her to authorize more of them.Here’s what Michigan Capitol Confidential reported last month on Tlaib’s history of supporting “corporate greed”:Among the bills Tlaib approved was one authorizing a $253 million subsidy for electric car battery makers. Another one was for $228 million for a state “21st Century Jobs Fund,” which writes subsidy checks to scores of private businesses.Here is a list of the bills, with the amount authorized by each:$100,000,000.

The Judicial Watch president claimed that he estimates between 43-44 million non-citizens reside in the United States. Fitton then suggested that about 10,12 or even 20 million of those are illegal aliens.  Fitton asked how many of those non-citizens vote? Fitton said that while President Trump would say between 5- 6 million vote, the Left claims none of them vote and that his guess, is it’s somewhere in between.If the Democrat Party has their way, illegal aliens will no longer be breaking laws when they vote in our elections.  Foreigners will only need to illegally cross our borders, and the Democrats will be waiting with directions to the nearest polling place and a mocked-up ballot in multiple languages, that tells them how to vote if they want to continue to enjoy all the “benefits” America has to offer.According to the Washington Times– House Democrats voted Friday to defend localities that allow illegal immigrants to vote in their elections, turning back a GOP attempt to discourage the practice.The vote marks a stunning reversal from just six months ago when the chamber — then under GOP control — voted to decry illegal immigrant voting.“We are prepared to open up the political process and let all of the people come in,” Rep.

The reason they voted against the resolution, “condemning hate,” is because Democrat lawmakers rephrased the resolution so it wouldn’t focus on the anti-Semitism of one of their own members. Instead, the resolution called out hate against Hispanics and gays.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez attempted to shift the narrative, and scold the GOP for not supporting the Democrat Party’s watered down version of the resolution that was intended to censure Rep.

He went scorched earth on the hypocrite Democrat lawmakers and Muslim anti-Semitic U.S. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (MN) during their meeting in the House chambers yesterday, that was supposed to be for the purposes of censoring the anti-Semitic lawmaker.Zeldin came out strong against his fellow Democrat lawmakers. He reminded the members of Congress that they were gathered together to address multiple occasions when “one member of the Chamber” made “anti-Semitic” comments.Zeldin correctly revealed the hypocrisy of the Democrat Party and how they only address “hate” if it doesn’t involve their party or members of their party. He told them, “If that member was a Republican, that member’s name would be in this resolution and this resolution would be all about condemning anti-Semitism and it would be done so forcefully.”“That member in January had to apologize for talking about a ‘hypnosis of Israel that they have over the entire world.’ That member had to apologize in February by saying if you support Israel, it must be because you’re bought off by Jews. That member called it an ‘unequivocal apology’ even though it was filled it with equivocations.  And now, we’re back again, this time by saying that if you support the Israel relationship, you must’ve pledged allegiance to a foreign government. Except for this time, that member is refusing to apologize. Even if you gave that member every benefit of the doubt—that she had no idea what she was doing, why now, wouldn’t she be apologizing? Why would she be more emboldened to refuse an apology altogether? I apparently, am giving Omar more credit than the speaker is because I don’t believe she is naive. I believe that she knows exactly what she is doing.It is an American value, by the way, to have reasonable legitimate criticism of a government, whether it be the U.S. government, Israel or any other government. It is not an American value though to be hurling anti-Semitism.We have members of this Chamber who have associated with Louis Farrakhan, who says, quote, ‘Hitler is a very great man.'”Zeldin continued to prove the double standard of the Democrat Party, using the removal of GOP Rep.

Although anti-Semitism is on the rise worldwide, Democrat lawmakers skirted Omar’s anti-Semitic remarks and changed the language of the measure, watering it down to make it a more broad condemnation of those who discriminate against “Latinos, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, and the LGBT” as well as “African-Americans, Native Americans, and other people of color, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, immigrants, and others.”The Hill reported that Zeldin, a Jewish member of Congress who previously sparred with Omar, argued the freshman congresswoman should have been identified in the text of the resolution, noting it is not the first time the House has voted to rebuke controversial remarks that were seen as anti-Semitic.“In January, we came to this chamber, we condemned white supremacy, we named a Republican member, we kicked that member off his committees. He can’t serve on the Small Business Committee, but this member will continue to serve on the House Foreign Affairs Committee,” he said on the floor ahead of the vote, comparing King to Omar.“But no, now we can’t come here and just emphatically, solely, forcibly condemn anti-Semitism and name names. But if it was a Republican we would. It’s time to call out these things for what they are: pointed, bigoted, unreasonable, illegitimate, anti-Semitic.”Cheney — a member of leadership, who currently serves as the House Republican Conference chair — said that while she stands “wholeheartedly against discrimination outlined in this resolution,” she felt it failed to address the “issue that is front and center.”“Rep. Omar’s comments were wrong and she has proven multiple times that she embodies a vile, hate-filled, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel bigotry. She deserves to be rebuked, by name, and removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee so that there is no mistake about the values and priorities that the House stands for,” she said. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, held a press conference today in which she was asked if Rep. Ilhan Omar needs to apologize for her anti-Semitic remarks. Pelosi did everything she could to excuse the bad behavior by Omar.Nancy Pelosi refuses to say if Ilhan Omar should apologize for her anti-Semitism, saying she doesn’t think Omar understood what she was saying.Rep.

A new conservative group founded by millennial Jews called “Jexodus” should scare every Democrat politician, as it comes on the heels of “Blexit” another popular movement for Black Americans who looking to leave the Democrat plantation that was started by Turning Point USA Communications Director Candace Owens.The Daily Wire reports – For decades, the Democratic Party has often taken the Jewish-American vote for granted. In 2016, 71% of Jews pulled the lever for Hillary Clinton.While the minority of American Jews who identify as Orthodox routinely favor the Republican Party at the ballot box, non-Orthodox Jews tend to overwhelmingly support Democrats.Now, a new, Millennial-centric group — “Jexodus” — seeks to reverse this longstanding trend.Per a press release from Jexodus’s soft launch at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, D.C. last Friday, here is how the group self-describes:We are proud Jewish Millennials tired of living in bondage to leftist politics. We reject the hypocrisy, anti-Americanism, and anti-Semitism of the rising far-left. Progressives, Democrats, and far too many old-school Jewish organizations take our support for granted. After all, we’re Jewish, and Jews vote for Democrats.Until today.We are determined and we are unafraid to speak for ourselves. As combatants and veterans of the campus wars, we know the threat progressivism poses to Jews. We’ve had front row seats witnessing anti-Semites hide behind the thin veil of anti-Zionism. We know the BDS movement harbors deep hatred not only for Israel, but for Jews. We’re done standing with supposed Jewish leaders and allegedly supportive Democrats who rationalize, mainstream, and promote our enemies. We’d rather spend forty years wandering in the desert than belong to a party that welcomes Jew-haters like Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Jexodus is the brainchild of Jeff Ballabon — a longstanding fixture in Republican Jewish circles — and an assortment of like-minded activists like Bruce Abramson, Ballabon’s frequent op-ed coauthor.Jexodus’s national spokesperson is Elizabeth Pipko, a religious Jew and a part-time model with close ties to President Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign.The 23-year-old model Elizabeth Pipko, has appeared on covers and on the pages of several magazines.According to the New York Post– Pipko kept a secret from her industry colleagues out of fear it could derail her career: She was a Donald Trump supporter and worked full-time on his 2016 presidential campaign.I decided to volunteer for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in the spring of 2016. I never leaned liberal or conservative, but there was something about Trump — the way he spoke and his honesty — that had me convinced he was our next president. I worked in a call center in Trump Tower. Within eight weeks, I was hired as a national volunteer services coordinator for the data team and paid $4,000 a month.It was clear from the start that, if I wanted to survive in modeling, I couldn’t tell anyone about my new job.Once, after working a 10-hour-day on the Trump campaign, I went to meet with my manager (who was not affiliated with a modeling agency). He and a colleague were enraged, screaming about how much they hate Trump. My manager kept saying how evil the people who work for him must be and that he would never work with anyone who supported him.I was terrified they would find out that I was one of the so-called evil people.So I lied and told people I was coaching ice skating — I was a competitive figure skater for seven years — whenever I was really hard at work in Trump Tower. When I ran into a modeling friend on my way there one day, I immediately hid my badge and said I was running errands.But at every modeling job or meeting, the talk inevitably turned to Trump, and it was always high-stress.At one shoot, the photographer came in wearing a black T-shirt with a gigantic red slash over Trump’s face. I was so unnerved, I could barely concentrate on the job at hand.But now that it’s been two years since the election, I don’t want to keep silent any longer. Even if that means saying goodbye to modeling forever.Pikpka’s husband Darren Centinello, is part of Trump’s digital campaign.  Happy Valentine’s Day to the love of my life, my partner in crime, and the best thing to ever happen to me❤️A post shared by  Elizabeth Pipko Centinello (@elizabethpipko) on Feb 14, 2019 at 7:20am PSTPipka met her husband, Darren Centinello (see photo below), who works on trump’s digital and social media campaign for the 2020 race.

It is a fantasy based on hopes and dreams with no basis in reality.There’s never been a more economically destructive, job-killing, environmentally harmful, costly and impractical proposal that has drawn so much support from members of Congress and White House hopefuls.Not only is the Green New Deal impossible to achieve. Just trying to accomplish its absurd and harmful goals could send our nation into another Great Depression, throw millions of Americans out of work, and turn the American Dream into a nightmare.Only one of the Green New Deal’s goals – reducing income inequality – is realistic.

Instead of the U.S. government worrying about migrants streaming into America illegally to build better lives, Mexico and Canada would have to deal with millions of Americans fleeing the poverty and hopelessness of the United States.You could fill a book with all the harmful consequences of the Green New Deal.Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore ripped the freshman Democrat congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to shreds in a tweet. Over the past week, it’s been rumoured that the socialist lawmaker, Ocasio-Cortez, has now wrested power from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, with her even more illogical and radical ideology. In response to Ocasio-Cortez’s “New Green Deal,” Moore tweeted:Pompous little twit. You don’t have a plan to grow food for 8 billion people without fossil fuels, or get the food into the cities. Horses? If fossil fuels were banned every tree in the world would be cut down for fuel for cooking and heating.

If you don’t like the #GreenNewDeal, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal to address the global climate crisis.Until then, we’re in charge – and you’re just shouting from the cheap seats.Pompous little twit.

136,06-Mar-19,"The beauty of President Trump is his ability to connect with everyday Americans. It didn’t just start with his presidency. Long before Donald J. Trump became President of the United States, there were stories of his generosity and acts of kindness, but most of those have been ignored by the media who originally reported about them, as they quickly turned on him the moment he became the GOP candidate for President.It all started after his sister, Bridgette Hoskie, who serves as a city councilwoman, and calls herself  “100 percent Democrat” started a campaign to help her younger brother, who is dying of cystic fibrosis, connect with President Trump.Jay W. Barrett, 44, who began home hospice on Sunday, hasn’t been able to attend any of Trump’s rallies or even fulfill his wish of visiting Washington D.C. — his fantasy is to shake Trump’s hand — because he’s so vulnerable to“My brother is very conservative, but politics aside, I think in a family religion and politics are off the table,” she said. “He hasn’t always had it easy and been able to do the things other people do. But yeah, he’s my baby brother — time is chasing us.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]When Barrett took a downturn recently and was treated at Yale-New Haven Hospital, Hoskie took to Facebook, discreetly asking friends there to “help in making something on my brother’s bucket list a reality.” She wrote that it was a “secret/surprise” and asked those interested to private message her or make a comment and she’d message them.Her private message to the willing was, “Please log onto whitehouse.gov and send a request to the president asking him to contact my brother. He loves Trump and it’s on his bucket list. He’s currently in Yale’s ICU so this happening would be amazing. Use your info and my brothers in the message.”The New Hamphire Register reorts – A terminally ill man who is a devout President Donald J. Trump fan got to scratch a biggie off his bucket list Tuesday when he received a surprise telephone call from Trump himself.“I can’t believe that he called — I’m ecstatic about it,” Jay W. Barrett, 44, said. “It was an amazing experience.”
Recommended VideoOne sentence into the telephone call, the two sounded like old buddies, with Barrett dropping conversational expletives.Trump began the conversation by saying, “ All right, Jay, you look handsome to me. I just saw a picture of you.” Barrett responded that Trump was giving him “kind honors,” and words to the effect of he doesn’t took so good — using a word not suitable for a family newspaper. Trump laughed.“How are you doing? How is it going, Jay?”Barrett answers, “It’s going, you know what I mean?”To which Trump said, “You’re a champ. You’re fighting it right?”To which Barrett said, “That’s what the Irish do — right?” To which Trump agreed heartily, saying, “Yeah that’s what the Irish do — you better believe it.”Trump sounded robust and charming.Trump said to Barrett: “I wish you could come to a rally. I wish you could come. I know you like that stuff and I wish you could.” Trump added, “It sounds like you have a great sister, Jay.”Barrett told the president, “Listen, if you can pencil me in I’ll find a way to get there.”Trump then said when he’s “up around that territory” — noting he knows the area well — “You’ll be sitting front row, center.”Barrett told Trump he plans on coming down to D.C. “between now and my expiration date.”That’s where a video of the conversation stopped, although the talking continued.President Trump has a history of stepping in when others are facing hardships to help out.When singer Jennifer Hudson’s was murdered, President Trump gave her and her family shelter in his Trump International Hotel and Tower free of charge.The now anti-Trump People magazine praised Donald J. Trump for his generosity in 2008:Donald Trump doesn’t just have the golden touch for business – he also has a heart of gold.“She’s a great girl. And we’re protecting them well,” Trump told PEOPLE at a benefit honoring Australia director Baz Luhrman at the Museum of Modern Art Monday night. “They are very safe.”Hudson has been seeking refuge at the Trump holding since her mother, brother and nephew were murdered in Chicago on Oct. 24.The Buffalo News has DELETED as story they reported about in October, 2013 that tells the story of an incredibly kind gesture by Donald J. Trump, after a bus driver saved the life of a woman attempting to commit suicide.Darnell Barton was driving his bus across a bridge when he spotted a woman on the other side of railing, staring down at the traffic below. Barton stopped the bus and approached the woman. After one of his passengers explained they didn’t want to “see someone die,” he managed to put his arm around her and she agreed to come to the other side of the bridge.After hearing about what Barton did, The Donald sent him ten thousand dollars.Trump said:The New York Daily News article about the bus driver’s beautiful act of kindess can be found here.",fake

139,04-Mar-19,"Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar has received her fair share of criticism over her open hatred for Israel. In 2012, the Muslim MN State Rep, who is now a freshman US Congresswoman, tweeted about Israel, asking “Allah” to “awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.”On February 10, 2019, freshman lawmaker, Ilhan Omar found herself in some hot water when once again, the Muslim lawmaker was caught tweeting derogatory remarks about Jews, saying “It’s all about the Benjamins baby” when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called her out for her anti-Israel remarks.Her comments were seen by many as more anti-semitic rhetoric from the lawmaker. It’s not uncommon for anti-Semites to make reference to Jews and money. On May 1st, 2018, the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas blamed Jews for the Holocaust, claiming, Jews in Europe provoked the Holocaust because of their “social function” as money lenders. Omar’s tweet appears to be falling in lockstep with the controversial Palestinian leader.The Intelligencer reports – After wide condemnation, Omar apologized. It seemed fair to read her tweet generously: Perhaps she was not familiar with the particular vein of anti-Semitism she happened to echo. Indeed, progressives often make crudely reductive statements about the influence of money in supporting policies they oppose (to wit: everything Bernie Sanders says), so it wasn’t necessarily anti-Semitic for Omar to extend that thinking to Jews. Her apparently sincere apology seemed to set to rest a minor offense.But at an event last night, Omar went much farther, reports Laura Kelly. After an audience member shouted out, “It’s all about the Benjamins,” at which, according to Kelly’s reporting, she smiled. (Jeremy Slevin, Omar’s press secretary and strategist, denies she acknowledged that line from the audience.) Later she stated, “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.”This is much worse. Accusing Jews of “allegiance to a foreign country” is a historically classic way of delegitimizing their participation in the political system. Whether or not the foreign policy agenda endorsed by American supporters of Israel is wise or humane, it is a legitimate expression of their political rights as American citizens. To believe in a strong American alliance with Israel (or Canada, or the United Kingdom, or any other country) is not the same thing as giving one’s allegiance to that country. Omar is directly invoking the hoary myth of dual loyalty, in which the Americanness of Jews is inherently suspect, and their political participation must be contingent upon proving their patriotism.Now, it’s being reported by Politico, that House Democratic leaders will put a resolution on the floor Wednesday in response to controversial remarks about Israel from Rep. Ilhan Omar.Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Democrats will take floor action Wednesday in response to controversial remarks by Rep. Ilhan Omar about Israel, the second such rebuke of the freshman Democrat from party leaders in recent weeks.Pelosi and other senior Democrats have drafted a resolution to address the controversy, which ballooned over the weekend following a public clash between Omar and senior Jewish lawmakers.The resolution, which began circulating to members Monday night, comes after a backlash from top Democrats who accused Omar of anti-Semitism for referring to pro-Israel advocates’ “allegiance to a foreign country.”The draft measure is four pages that largely details the history and recent rise of anti-Semitism in the U.S. but does not specifically name Omar, which had been an internal dispute among Democrats.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Instead, it condemns the “myth of dual loyalty,” using the same language as top Democrats, like House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey, who have condemned Omar in recent days.If the House moves ahead with the vote on Wednesday as planned, it would be an unprecedented public rebuke of Omar, who was sworn into office just over 60 days ago. Omar’s office declined to comment about the Democratic resolution on Monday.Yet these efforts by Pelosi and other Democratic leaders won’t be enough for Republicans, who want a more serious punishment for Omar.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other senior Republicans are considering offering a censure motion against Omar, according to GOP sources. Republicans may also formally demand that Democrats strip Omar of her seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, a move that Pelosi and other senior Democrats won’t take at this point.Ilhan Omar has:-Blamed U.S. for Islamic terror attacks-Laughed while talking about Al-Qaeda-Called for ending DHS-Advocated for leniency for men convicted of trying to join ISIS-Voted in MN against ending terrorist life insurance payoutsForgive America for being skeptical https://t.co/sT7HmRCEzn— Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) March 4, 2019Three days ago, Omar tweeted a photo of graffiti that was allegedly scribbled on a bathroom wall calling for her assassination.Ignoring the tremendous amount of hate and vitriol she’s been spewing about President Trump, Omar took to Twitter to post aNo wonder why I am on the “Hitlist” of a domestic terrorist and “Assassinate Ilhan Omar” is written on my local gas stations.Look no further, the GOP’s anti-Muslim display likening me to a terrorist rocks in state capitols and no one is condemning them!pic.twitter.com/jIjlfZNHw5— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) March 1, 2019According to the AP – The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are looking into a report of a threatening graffiti message directed at U.S. Rep.

140,04-Mar-19,"Vice interviewed eight young black people about President Trump. Four of the people in the group are conservatives, four of them are liberals. Almost every single one of them voted for Barack Obama, not just once, but twice, and most of them admit it was because he is black. The conversation becomes heated at times but is very telling, in that it exposes the reality of how conservatives take personal responsibility, as opposed to how liberals believe they are victims that need to given special privileges or advantages by someone else. When asked about President Trump, liberals resort to using emotion to explain their dislike for him, while the conservatives articulated their reasons for supporting him by using facts, and by describing how they align themselves with his policies.The most victimized person on the stage is George, he’s wearing glasses and is seated in the upper right corner of the screen. George is the epitome of the classic anti-Trump liberal, who is living in perpetual victimhood. Although he doesn’t clearly articulate his sexual identity, he attempts to convince the group that he is an expert on all matters having to do with the LGBT community in American, and how Trump’s policies are destroying their rights. He starts by falsely claiming that Trump doesn’t care about the rights of the LGBT community, stating that, “In 2017, the office of National AIDS policy was taken away.” George falsely claims that he has evidence Trump doesn’t care about HIV or AIDS, even though President Trump recently made a public commitment to end AIDS in America within the next 10 years. George points out the transgender military ban to explain how Trump and his policies are hurting gays, calling it part of an “attack” on LGBT rights. As a point of reference, a minuscule .30% of Americans identify as “transgender” in America.The conservative gay man refutes the claim that Trump doesn’t care about gays, saying, “It’s curious to me because I’m somebody who is gay. I’m gay, I’m not queer. I’m not LGBT.” He’s immediately interrupted by the victimized gay man, who attempts to tell him that because he refuses to be defined by the terms set forth by the left, that he, “can’t speak” to what it means to be gay. Huh?The self-identified gay conservative man continues, saying, “We talk about our community as if everybody that’s transgender is infected with HIV or has housing insecurity. That everybody’s that’s gay, or lesbian, black or whatever.” Again, he’s quickly interrupted by the liberals on the panel, who pounce on him. Smiling, and undeterred by their interruptions, he continues, “This is how we speak of our community all the time as if we are all some oppressed victim.” He explains that he was raised in a poor area of Dayton, Ohio, and was a member of the U.S. military who fought and protested against Bill Clinton’s “Don’t’ ask, don’t tell” legislation. He’s also a two time Obama voter who has since seen the light and is now firmly in Donald Trump’s corner.When the gay conservative male reaches his limit listening to the gay liberal male, he attempts to stop his “oppressive systems” and “intersectionality” nonsense, saying, “What we really need to talk about is how do we help the people right now?” The conservative woman sitting in the front row turns around and thanks him for stopping the nonsense. The man sitting next to the gay man in the top row explains how he has made “a lot of money under a Trump presidency.” He explains how President Trump is bringing jobs back into the United States, saying, “Black unemployment is the lowest that it’s been in American history” saying “That benefits not just me, but any person’s that’s black. A lot of things Trump’s done when it comes to jobs and the economy when it comes to the stock market. I’m investing for the first time in my life, and I’m making a lot of money. Thank you, President Trump!” He continues, “And I’m a black man. Is there an invisible wall that says, ‘oh, you’re black, you can’t invest?’ No. We need to stop playing ‘victim’ and become ‘victor.'”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]When the subject of the government paying back student loans is brought up, the conservative woman in the center of the front row explains that even though she runs her own successful business that’s unrelated to her degree, she is still responsible for paying the student loans back that she took out for college. Earlier in the segment, she explains her background that includes a felony conviction, and how she’s surrounded by relatives that are selling drugs, and looking for the easy way to make cash. She also explains how it was her conversion to Christianity that brought her to Trump. Time and time again, in many different parts of the discussion, she completely obliterates the liberals on the panel with facts and reasoning. Her determination and will to be self-sufficient and to do things on her terms is inspirational. She is truly an example of what it means to live the American dream and to fight for the right to be an individual.Watch:During President Trump’s recent State Of The Union speech, he addressed his resolve to rid the world of HIV and AIDS. His comments refute everything George claimed to be correct about Trump not caring about gays with HIV. Trump explained his commitment to Congress and the American people, “My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic within 10 years in the United States. We have made incredible strides. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.” In a speech at the White House, Vice President Mike Pence also discussed the commitment by both him and President Trump to defeat HIV and AIDS. During his speech, the Vice President, who has been falsely mischaracterized as someone who “hates” gays, announced that President Trump would be signing PEPFAR, an emergency plan pushed the President and passed by a bipartisan Congress, with the goal of completely eradicating AIDS worldwide.“President Trump believes this reauthorization is a critical component of our administration’s commitment to combat AIDS and it will build on the renewed energy and focus that the president has brought in our entire administration, have brought to this critical issue,” Pence told the crowd.What do you think about the video above? Do you think the liberals on the panel helped to further their narrative that President Trump doesn’t care about the black community and that he’s a racist or do you think they harmed their argument? Do you think the conservatives made some of the people on the panel see they were wrong about Trump? Tell us what you think in the comment section below.",fake

Kamala Harris resigned Wednesday after The Sacramento Bee inquired about a $400,000 harassment and retaliation settlement resulting from his time working for Harris at the California Department of Justice.Larry Wallace, who served as the director of the Division of Law Enforcement under then-Attorney General Harris, was accused by his former executive assistant in December 2016 of “gender harassment” and other demeaning behavior, including frequently asking her to crawl under his desk to change the paper in his printer.The lawsuit was filed on Dec. 30, 2016, when Harris was still attorney general but preparing to be sworn in as California’s newly elected Democratic senator. It was settled less than five months later, in May 2017, by Xavier Becerra, who was appointed to replace her as attorney general.By that time, Wallace had transitioned to work for Harris as a senior advisor in her Sacramento office.“We were unaware of this issue and take accusations of harassment extremely seriously. This evening, Mr. Wallace offered his resignation to the senator and she accepted it,” Harris spokeswoman Lily Adams wrote in an email.Harris, who has said she will decide over the holidays whether to run for president in 2020, has been a prominent figure in the #MeToo movement against workplace sexual harassment. Last year, she was among a group of female senators that were the first to call for the resignation of Sen. Al Franken after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct, and she introduced a bill in June to ban forced nondisclosure agreements in harassment settlements.During her questioning, Harris asked Kavanaugh, “Have you had any conversation about Robert Mueller or his investigation with anyone at” the law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres.Kavanaugh responded by saying he wasn’t sure who works at that specific firm, which employs an estimated 300 people.Harris begins with a vague, leading question that can be misinterpreted in any number of ways. The senator then belittles the witness by claiming the question isn’t complicated. She then offers to clarify the question, all the while pretending to be precise, and then restates her original, confusing line of inquiry almost verbatim.This sort of interrogation is designed to trick a scared and ill-informed suspect into saying something that can later be twisted and used against him by the prosecution. In many cases, this tactic works. But Kavanaugh was smart enough to insist on precise language, much to Harris’ obvious chagrin. Unfortunately, a lot of the people who get caught up in the criminal justice system don’t have Kavanaugh’s background or presence of mind. These people often find themselves on the losing end of the underhanded word games preferred by prosecutors like Harris.All of this is to say: Wednesday’s interaction between Harris and Kavanaugh reminds me of the senator’s shameful record when she served as the district attorney of San Francisco and as California’s attorney general.In that position, she was a petty tyrant who regularly advocated for absurdly harsh penalties, all while protecting her corrupt friends in government. She was a cheerleader for civil asset forfeiture. She championed an anti-truancy law that called for a $2,000 fine and jail time for the parents (by 2012, two mothers were imprisoned in California under this law). She even opposed attempts to do away with the state’s draconian three-strikes law, which called for life sentences for a third “strike” even if it was only a minor felony.Watch the exchange here:",fake

But according to the filings, as first spotted by the Washington Free Beacon, Tlaib also paid herself $2,000 on Nov. 16 and a whopping $15,500 on Dec. 1 – weeks after the election was over, in an apparent violation of FEC statutes.This isn’t the first time the radical Democrat lawmaker’s ethics have been called into question, he also neglected to report a large sum of money she received from radical globalist, George Soros.According to the Washington Free Beacon, Congresswoman-elect Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) did not disclose the name of the source of funds for a fellowship that was paid by liberal billionaire George Soros—as required by the House ethics committee—and also disclosed a lesser amount than she received, according to a review of tax and financial disclosure forms.The Washington Free Beacon obtained the most recent copies of tax forms for a number of Soros’s organizations, including the Open Society Institute, the legal name for the Open Society Foundations, the entity in which Soros pushes millions in funding to a number of liberal causes and organizations.An expenditure of $85,307 to Rashida Tlaib in Detroit, Mich., from 2017 is shown on page 97 of the 321-page report to “to increase involvement of disenfranchised urban communities of color with their local governance process by creating a community benefits strategy for equitable development and creating a leadership training for impacted residents focused on negotiation skills and identifying leverage at the local level.”Tlaib did not report any income in the amount of $85,307 on financial disclosure forms submitted as she was running for office, which identified the names of the sources that provided her income in three of four cases.

145,01-Mar-19,"Muslim lawmaker Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Socialist-Democrat, NY) were featured with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and freshman Congresswoman Jahana Hayes (D-CT) on the most recent cover of Rolling Stone magazine. The Rolling Stone article attempts to bolster the false narrative that the Democrat Party, who are fighting to kill full-term babies, and allow them to die when they are born alive after a botched abortion, are somehow the “party of women.”The article is filled with fluff and praise for the Democrat women who all fall into one or more victim categories, but it’s the interview with freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who’s able to check off multiple victim categories, that is quite revealing.The Rolling Stone article by Tessa Stuart begins by addressing Omar’s hijab and why she wears it. Omar admits that she didn’t always wear her hijab; it wasn’t until after the horrible attack on America by Islamic extremists on 9-11, that she chose to wear her hijab to make a statement.From the article:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]As a teen in Minnesota, Ilhan Omar didn’t wear a hijab often. “I, regretfully, was one of the folks who would only wear it the days I didn’t have the time or energy to fix my hair,” says Omar, who arrived in the U.S. in 1995 as a refugee of the Somali civil war. Her attitude evolved after September 11th: “I knew we had a responsibility to help shape a narrative about our faith that is positive.”Omar admits that she didn’t wear the hijab because of her faith, but wore it after 9-11 as a way to defend her faith? Since Omar was elected as a State Representative in Minnesota, she’s done very little to elevate her faith or to show any signs of positivity. She’s been accused of marrying her own brother to help him commit immigration fraud. She’s also been accused of a number of campaign finance violations. Only weeks into her new role as a U.S. lawmaker, Omar falsely accused sitting U.S. Senator, Lindsey Graham (R-SC) of “being compromised” (many believed this was a veiled threat, as she wanted others to believe that someone had the ‘goods’ on Graham, forcing him to admit he was gay). More than one anti-Semitic tweet showed up on her personal account. Omar’s defense was that she was confused about why the tweets were offensive to Jews?To date, Omar shows no signs of helping to shape a positive image of either herself or her faith.From the Rolling Stone article:This year, she became the first woman sworn in to Congress in a headscarf, after negotiating the end to a 181-year-old edict that representatives must “remain uncovered” while on the House floor. Lifting the ban caused an outcry from some conservatives, but, as an unapologetic progressive, Omar is getting used to that.For now, though, she’s trying to stay focused on the agenda she came to Washington to advance, and on advocating for people like herself —refugees,immigrants,Muslims,women,Minnesotans.It’s worth noting that when Ilhan Omar lists who she’s advocating for in Washington D.C., she names herself first, then refugees, followed by immigrants, Muslims, women and then finally, the people who elected her, Minnesotans. It’s likely no accident that Omar puts Minnesota residents dead last—after all, they’re not part of a victim category.You came to the U.S. when you were 12. What were your first impressions?We had a layover in New York. I remember seeing homeless people and panhandlers on the streets. There was trash everywhere, and graffiti. I remember turning to my dad and saying, “This doesn’t look like the America you promised.” He said, “Girl, you ask too many questions. We’re gonna get to our America.”Was the “our America” Omar’s father referred to, the Cedar-Riverside area of Minneapolis, Minnesota, otherwise known as “little Mogadishu?”According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Ilhan Omar’s hometown of Cedar-Riverside is has taken on its own, separate identity from Minneapolis – Separated from the rest of Minneapolis by the Mississippi River and two freeways, the neighborhood operates like a self-sustaining village. “That’s allowed it to develop on its own and retain its character,” said Michael Tolan, of the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota.Fox News reports – More men and boys from a Somali American community in Minneapolis have joined – or attempted to join – a foreign terrorist organization over the last 12 years than any other jurisdiction in the country. With by far the largest Somali American population in the United States – estimates of up to 100,000 – the insular ethnic community in Minnesota offers a rich recruiting ground.As a point of reference, here’s an image from the Somali Civil War Ilhan Omar and her father were rescued from, before they landed in New York City, where Omar was stunned by the “trash” and “homeless” people on the streets of America. It seems like an odd comment to make considering there were no tanks with rogue, rag-tag rebels armed to the hilt, ravaging the city of New York, terrorizing its citizens.It should also be noted, that in 1995 when Omar and her father arrived in America from the war-torn sh*thole of Somali, Rudy Giuliani was in his first year as the acting mayor of New York City, where he later gained the reputation for cleaning up the homelessness crisis.Near the end of the Rolling Stone article, Omar is asked about impeaching President Trump, something that appears to be high on the lawmaker’s list of to-do’s.You might be asked to vote on impeachment at some point. What are your thoughts about that possibility?I believe that impeachment is inevitable. It also is a terrifying notion. Pence is an ideologue, and the ideology he holds is more terrifying to me and my constituents. And we have not had a full impeachment that removes the president from office. Nations struggle any time [they] overthrow a dictator, and Trump really has the markings of a dictator.Daily Caller’s Ryan Saavedra points out that Omar’s comments make her guilty of the crime of “Advocating the overthrow of the Government.” Saavedra points out that Omar’s remarks to Rolling Stone magazine, where she appears to be suggesting overthrowing our President, make her guilty of a crime punishable of a fine, or 20 years in prison, or both. He also points out that should she be found guilty that Omar would not be able to be employed by the United States government or any agency thereof for five years following her conviction.Calling Attorney General William Barr…???18 U.S. Code § 2385. Advocating overthrow of Government:Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the 5 years next following his conviction https://t.co/SV7H5Mx3Fc— Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) March 1, 2019Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.So there you have it.  Ilhan Omar, the woman the media and the Democrat Party would like you to believe embodies the American dream. Minnesota residents need to wake up and realize who they just appointed to one of the highest positions in our federal government. They’ll get a shot in 2020 to replace her, but will Omar be removed from office before then? Will Attorney General Barr take her threats seriously? Will Republicans in Congress and the voters in Minnesota start taking this woman seriously, or will they wait until it’s too late?  ",fake
146,01-Mar-19,"With the appearance of Lynne Patton during the Michael Cohen hearing, questions have been raised about why Cohen flipped to turn on President Trump.It’s odd that Cohen had previously defended President Trump. He had written to defend the president against those who were claiming he’s a racist. Cohen was 100% in the Trump camp. So what happened?The guy who flipped so fast from saying “I’d never walk away” to becoming a Mueller “informant” could have dirty cops threatening him:The Conservative Treehouse might have the answer. They went back to Facebook posts from January of last year and found what could be the answer to why Cohen flipped on the president:Lynne Patton: […] 3) Many of you may already know that I considered Michael Cohen to be one of my very best friends. Countless people can confirm that we were virtually inseparable during my employment at Trump and that he is, single-handedly – responsible for introducing me to the Trump family and effectively changing my entire life. I would be lying if I didn’t admit that my heart still breaks for him and for his family, with whom I had grown extremely close.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]4) What many of you may not be aware of is the fact that I can personally confirm that the ONLY reason Michael Cohen “turned on” the President of the United States is that Mueller threatened to throw his wife in jail for up to 30 years. Period. She is the co-guarantor of a $20M personal loan that Mueller discovered Michael secured back in 2015 by falsely inflating the value of his taxi medallions – effectively making her part & parcel to the federal charge of “Making False Statements to a Financial Institution,” to which Cohen ultimately plead guilty. This is also the reason why Cohen’s longtime taxi medallion partner, Evgeny “Gene” Freidman, was granted immunity. (read more)Cohen went from saying he’d be willing to “take a bullet” for Trump to being willing to “take a bullet” for his wife.Was Cohen really threatened to coerce him into testifying against President Trump?If the track record of Weismann and Mueller is taken into account, you can bet it’s a possibility.Weissmann is known as Mueller’s hard-charging lawyer with a reputation for going overboard with threats to flip defendants :The LA Times reports: A graduate of Princeton and Columbia Law School, Weissmann first made his mark as a federal prosecutor in New York City in the 1990s, leveraging evidence and threats of lengthy prison sentences to “flip’’ mob underlings to testify in trials of organized crime bosses.Weissmann is known for pushing the legal boundaries and is famous for going scorched earth.Could the threats and coercion of Michael Cohen backfire with a charge of prosecutorial misconduct?

Great question!In the end, ‘Russian collusion’ is nothing more than a Democratic cocktail, designed to sooth the jagged nerves of those poor souls suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome. It is concocted of one part fantasy, two parts desperation, and three parts hate. Constantly shaken and stirred up by the media and poured out as bitter liberal tears. Cheers!TRANSCRIPT:Michael Cohen spent a decade as Trump’s high-profile lobbyer, toady, defender and personal attorney. And then one day, he decided that he hated Donald Trump and became Donald Trump’s mortal enemy. A big change. How did that happen?Well, Cohen told Congress this week that he had a kind of a road to Damascus experience. He was personally and morally offended by what his boss said on two occasions. First, after the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, that was the summer of 2017 and later, when he watched Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland about a year later. Those two scandals, both of them fraudulent, entirely manufactured by the left and its servants in the media, changed Michael Cohen’s mind forever.Democrats must have been gratified to hear that. Michael Cohen is a sensitive, progressive now. He is tormented by climate change and his own toxic masculinity. He is basically a one-man crusade against privilege. He is a new man. That’s his story.Well, now comes a Daily Mail piece that puts a different gloss on it. It turns out, just weeks before the FBI raided his offices last summer, Michael Cohen was shopping a book proposal. In the manuscript, which the Daily Mail has, Cohen professes love and admiration for Donald Trump. In the book proposal, Cohen defends the president against claims that he is “crazy, dumb, paranoid, in over his head or a liar” — all claims that Cohen made this week before Congress. Keep in mind that Cohen wrote the book proposal well after Charlottesville and Helsinki, those scandals that just changed him as a man.It turns out that Michael Cohen is not a very reliable narrator. But too late, he is the narrator the Democrats have chosen, and they are stuck with him. They brought him to Capitol Hill on Wednesday in the hope, the expectation, that he would prove the Russia conspiracy true.He didn’t. Instead, he demolished that conspiracy. Nobody on the left wants to admit that, but we have the tape. Let’s start with the claim that Cohen held secret meetings with Russian agents in Prague in an effort to steal the 2016 election. On its face, it sounds nuts, but they have been telling you that for years. Even John Brennan has said it. Whatever his faults, he was literally the head of the CIA, the most powerful intelligence agency in the world, and he claimed to believe that. Oswald went to Mexico City, Cohen went to Prague … it’s the perfect conspiracy.Except that Michael Cohen has never been to Prague. He testified to that on Wednesday. And by the way, he had no incentive to lie about it.“Have you ever been to Prague?” Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. asked.“I have never been to Prague,” Cohen responded.“Never have?”“I’ve never been to [the] Czech Republic.”“Never been to Prague” … but I kind of like the music. How frustrating it must have been for Rep. Adam Schiff to hear that. “Never been to Prague.” This was the part where Michael Cohen was supposed to admit swapping micro-film with Vladimir Putin in the sauna at the Prague Marriott. Instead, he looked kind of mystified and admitted he had never even been to the country. Michael Cohen is from Long Island. He pretty much stays there.Okay, let’s try this again. How about the claim that Vladimir Putin’s agents have video of Donald Trump cavorting with hookers, and that’s how they’ve managed to blackmail Trump into saying nice things about Russia. We’ve been hearing about that since the day BuzzFeed first claimed it. If there is a hooker tape out there, I think it’s fair to assume that Michael Cohen would know about it. He is that kind of guy, a hooker tape kind of guy. Now would probably be the time he would tell us all about it, but no. “Are you aware of anything that the president has done at home or abroad that may have subjected him to or may subject him to extortion or blackmail?” asked Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md, at Wednesday’s hearing. “I am not. No,” Cohen said.“Okay, are you aware of any videotapes that may be the subject of extortion or blackmail?”I’ve heard about these tapes for a long time. I’ve had many people contact me over the years. I have no reason to believe that that tape exists.Oh damn, he did it again, straying from the script. Instead of confirming the Russia conspiracy that dominated and controlled American politics for more than two years, Michael Cohen just refuted it. What kind of witness is this guy anyway? This is getting very frustrating. Where do we get to the part where he blows the Russia case wide open and they lead Big Orange away in handcuffs and Hillary can be the president?Well, here is an idea, let’s just ask him directly. Did the Trump campaign collude with the Russian government during the 2016 election? Michael Cohen would know. He was there. By the way, it’s almost a rhetorical question. Democrats have long been absolutely certain that it happened.“I think there is plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has said.“We saw cold, hard evidence of the Trump campaign, and indeed the Trump family, eagerly intending to collude, possibly, with Russia,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said.“Plenty of evidence.” “Cold, hard evidence.” Well, if anyone can provide that kind of evidence, it would be Michael Cohen. After all, he was Donald Trump’s — is that really his name? No, it’s Donnell Troponovich. He was Donnell Troponovich’s personal attorney during the years that Troponovich was accepting suitcases full of rubles in exchange for subverting American democracy.So what is the answer, Mr. Cohen?“Based on what you know, would Mr. Trump or did he lie about colluding and coordinating with the Russians at any point during the campaign?” asked Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.“So, as I stated in my testimony, I wouldn’t use the word ‘colluding,'” Cohen replied. “Was there something odd about the back and forth praise with President Putin? Yes. But I’m not really sure that I can answer that question in terms of collusion.”The balloon just deflated. Talk about a let-down. No meeting in Prague. No blackmail. No collusion. No Russia conspiracy at all. It was all a hoax. It was a much less interesting Loch Ness monster. You’ve got to be feeling a little silly right now if you ever believed any of this.But wait. We’ve got one last idea. There is still a way Michael Cohen could send Donald Trump to prison even without Russia. What if Cohen could confirm that Trump once told him to lie to Congress? That would be obstruction of justice, at the very least. It would certainly be a crime. BuzzFeed ran a story alleging that happened. Yes, BuzzFeed is a cat blog run by unhappy people in Brooklyn. But who knows? Maybe there is something there. Certainly, cable news was convinced they had the latest bombshell from the cat blog –our last hope to end this infernal presidency and return to the happy status quo of 2010.Our hopes are on you, Michael Cohen. Did it actually happen? The reveal, please?“You lied to those congressional committees, is that correct?” Greg Steube, R-Fla., asked Cohen at Wednesday’s hearing.“Previously?” Cohen asked.“Correct.”“Yes, sir.”“You stated that Trump never directed you to lie to Congress. Is that correct?”“That’s correct.”No. Four for four. Michael Cohen strikes out. Game, set, match. The Trump presidency continues. The other team looks despondent. You can hear weeping from the press box.But wait, before we head to the parking lot and drive home, one final piece of business: What about all of the lies you just heard, not from Cohen, but from the others? Blackmail. Collusion. Russia, Russia, Russia! Are any of the liars who told those lies going to be punished for lying? Is anybody going to lose a job? Or a reputation? Or a contributor contract? Maybe just what happened to Carter Page? That might be enough.Is there any penalty for being relentlessly and recklessly dishonest for two solid years? For intentionally misleading the public in the service of a political agenda and a political party? The Democratic Party? Is a single person even going to concede what just happened, much less apologize for it?Of course not. It’s Washington. They will all be promoted tomorrow. You watch. ",fake

One asked Kim if he’s ‘ready to denuclearize.’ “If I’m not willing do that I won’t be here right now,” he said through an interpreter.“That’s a good answer,” said Pres.

153,27-Feb-19,"Mark Meadows didn’t waste any time today trying to call out Michael Cohen and his lawyer Lanny Davis.He was furious about the fact that rules of the House Select Committee had been broken with the release of evidence after the 24-hour rule. The rule is that any evidence to be presented must be done so 24 hours prior to the hearing. Evidence from Cohen’s lawyers wasn’t produced until the morning of the hearing.Meadows tried to delay the hearing (video below) because of the broken rule. The Dem majority on the committee overruled Meadows and voted to continue with the hearing.The hearing did nothing but put Michael Cohen into further jeopardy with the courts because Meadows exposed him for violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) during a heated exchange and later entered a referral for criminal investigation (see below):Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Meadows followed up by holding up a document, and addressing Cohen directly, “Under your testimony, just a few minutes ago, to me, you indicated that you had contracts with foreign entities. And yet, we have a ‘truth in testimony’ disclosure form, which requires you to list those foreign contracts for the last two years, and you put ‘N/A’ on there.” Meadows warned Cohen, “And it’s a criminal offense to not have that accurately. So when were you lying?— Either on the testimony to me earlier today or when you filled out the form?” Clinton lawyer, Lanny Davis leaned in and whispered to Cohen, as Rep. Meadows was revealing to the committee members that Cohen was just caught in another lie. Apparently, Cohen failed to list contracts with foreign companies that paid him for access to the Trump administration. Meadows mentioned a company called Novartis, which paid Cohen $1.2 million to act as a consultant on the Trump administration.Right after the exchange, Meadows tweeted out:I just entered a referral for criminal investigation of Michael Cohen, who violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act by illegally lobbying on behalf of foreign entities without registering Cohen talks about “blind loyalty.” His real blind loyalty?

157,26-Feb-19,"For a minute today on ABC’s “The View”, it almost felt like Megan McCain and Joy Behar might need to take their heated argument outside.Far left comedian turned political expert, Joy Behar, started out the segment by showing a clip of radical Socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) warning that humans need to stop reproducing in order to save the planet.On Monday, Senate Democrats blocked a bill put forth by Republican Senator Ben Sasse that would provide protections for babies born alive in the case of a botched abortion, or “infanticide.”After watching the video, where Ocasio-Cortez warned about “young people” wondering if “it’s okay to have children,” the unhinged Joy Behar asked, “shouldn’t people be worried and scared” about the world ending soon? Behar asked, “Don’t climate say we’re on the verge of doomsday?” Behar continued, “To me, like every time there’s a weather report, Al Roker should say, ‘It’s going to be 20 degrees in New York and another polar cap the size of Portugal has just dropped into the East River.” Behar said it was the obligation of the weathermen to keep everyone alarmed over man-made global warming, saying, “the weathermen need to tell us every day how close we’re getting to total disaster on this planet.”The View co-host Meghan McCain can be seen looking at Behar across the table like she’s a Martian who just landed on the set.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The other far-left host, Sonny Hostin, argued that Behar was correct and shared leftist propaganda to prove her point.Abby Huntsman, a conservative co-host on The View told Behar, “There’s a difference between caring about our climate and asking a legitimate question about doing away with the human race.” Huntsman laid into the radical freshman Congressman, saying, “Of all the things she’s [Ocasio-Cortez] said, this is by far the most outrageous.”A furious Meghan McCain interrupted to announce that every Democrat 2020 presidential candidate supported the infanticide bill. After McCain went through the list of Senate Democrats who are running for president in 2020 that voted to block the born alive bill. McCain warned her fellow Democrat activist hosts, “If Democrats want to win an election, going forward, are you going to be the party of late-term abortion? The party of infanticide?” McCain warned that the radical position Democrats have adopted about killing full term babies or babies who are born alive in botched abortions is “well outside of the mainstream” and will not serve the Democrat Party well in the future.The “pro-life” Hostin attempted to interject her opinion, as she attempted to explain that the bill isn’t really that bad, saying, “I need to push back on that” attempting to say that the bill the Senate Democrats blocked was to provide medical care for infants who survive failed abortions and that it’s extremely rare that this would ever happen.McCain wasn’t going to have any of it, interrupting her and calling it “disgusting’ and “infanticide!”The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act sponsored by Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse, would have required any health care provider present when a child is born alive after an abortion or attempted abortion to exercise the same degree of care they would provide to “any other child born alive at the same gestational age.” The bill would also require them to get the infant to a hospital.“Ugh! Keep saying it Democrats!” a frustrated Meghan replied.Joy Behar interrupted Meghan, shouting, “Let her tell her side!” McCain, who appeared to be unable to control her disgust over her co-host’s support of infanticide, continued to call it “disgusting!”Watch:",fake

160,25-Feb-19,"It’s no secret that the Clinton women are huge supporters of the legalized baby killing operation, Planned Parenthood. According to Gennifer Flowers, former mistress of then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, he’s also a big fan of Planned Parenthood, who at least once, was reportedly able to convince her to extinguish the life of their unborn child.According to the Daily Mail – Flowers, who claims she had a 12-year affair with Clinton, has opened up about her relationship with the former president, which she says began in 1977.The now-66-year-old says that Clinton personally paid $200 for her to get an abortion that same year, which was also when she says she learned that Hillary Clinton was aware of the alleged affair. The relationship continued for another 11, years, Flowers says.Speaking to Aaron Klein Investigative Radio, Flowers described her abortion as ‘not only physically painful but it was very psychologically painful’.Three years after Flowers allegedly had her abortion, Bill and Hillary’s daughter Chelsea was born in 1980.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Flowers recalled protesters being at the clinic and feared they would recognize her as a reporter. But after the procedure, when she was in a room alone, the pain settled in.‘I was sitting there and I just started sobbing and it seemed like the subs came from my stomach and up. It was the deepest sobs that I’ve ever done. And anyway like I said it was a horrible experience in every way,’ she told the radio show.Now, Life Site News reports on Chelsea Clinton bemoaning her grandmother’s inability to visit a Planned Parenthood facility.It’s one of the most bizarre quotes ever and Chelsea Clinton just gave it legs.Years ago, Chelsea Clinton made the strange comment that she was upset her maternal grandmother did not have access to the Planned Parenthood abortion business.As LifeNews reported at the time, Chelsea revealed that her much-admired maternal grandmother was the child of unwed teenage parents who “did not have access to services that are so crucial that Planned Parenthood helps provide.” If her grandmother had gone to Planned Parenthood for an abortion, Chelsea would not have been born.In a new interview with Planned Parenthood president Leana Wen, Clinton re-upped the comment:When I was on a panel recently with Cecile [Richards], I said how much I wish that my grandmother — my mom’s mom — had been able to go to a Planned Parenthood. She had unwed teenage parents who abandoned her multiple times throughout her life. She had to start working to support herself before her 14th birthday. She was aware that there was something deeply unjust about her situation, dealing with questions of menstruation and reproductive healthcare without somewhere to go.Of course, when I shared this, the anti-choice movement translated it as saying I wished my grandmother had aborted my mother. Which is, of course, not what I said and not what I meant.James Woods, conservative actor, and one of the wittiest people on social media, couldn’t help himself.

161,25-Feb-19,"The cranky old socialist and Democrat presidential retread candidate, Bernie Sanders, was featured in a video last week where he launched his campaign against his fellow Democrats in 2020, calling President Trump the “most dangerous president in modern American history.” During his plea for grassroots donations, Bernie promised to take on “powerful special interests” like “Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military industrial complex, the private prison industry, and the large multi-national corporations.”Bernie also promised to wave his socialist magic wand to cure everything that ills America, including, “racism, sexism, homophobia, and religious bigotry.” Someone should tell Bernie about the anti-Semitic freshmen congresswomen who belong to his beloved Democrat Party, as long as he’s trying to remove religious bigotry from America.Speaking of hypocrisy, how will Bernie put the fossil fuel industry out of business when his own PRIVATE JET travel expenses are making a major contribution to the health of the fossil fuel industry?According to Politico, in the final months of the 2016 campaign, Sanders repeatedly requested and received the use of a carbon-spewing private jet for himself and his traveling staff when he served as a surrogate campaigner for Hillary Clinton.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]In the two years following the presidential election, Sanders continued his frequent private jet travel, spending at least $342,000 on the flights.Increased scrutiny of his travel practices, which are at odds with his positions on wealth inequality and climate change, are among the challenges Sanders will face as he makes his second White House run.But he also faces another hurdle: hard feelings that remain to this day after the contentious 2016 Democratic primary. Many in the party continue to believe the Vermont senator played a role in contributing to Clinton’s defeat in November because of his criticisms of her prior to the general election, and his refusal to concede earlier when it appeared he had little mathematical chance of securing the party nomination.And they are eager to point out Sanders’ flaws and examples of what they perceive to be examples of hypocrisy now that the one-time underdog rates as one of the front-runners in the crowded Democratic field.“I’m not shocked that while thousands of volunteers braved the heat and cold to knock on doors until their fingers bled in a desperate effort to stop Donald Trump, his Royal Majesty King Bernie Sanders would only deign to leave his plush D.C. office or his brand new second home on the lake if he was flown around on a cushy private jet like a billionaire master of the universe,” said Zac Petkanas, who was the director of rapid response for the Clinton campaign.For many, the timing of the purchase of Bernie’s new $600,000 lake home was suspicious. The crotchety old Socialist, who’s never held an actual job other than that of a politician, landed his third luxury home almost immediately after agreeing to back Hillary Clinton after she defeated him in the primary election.On August 10, 2016, 100 Percent Fed Up published an article about the timing of Bernie’s new Lake Champlain lakefront home:From the article: Sanders’ new crib has four bedrooms and 500 feet of Lake Champlain beachfront on the east side of the island — facing Vermont, not New York. The Bern will keep his home in Burlington and use the new camp seasonally.“We’ve traveled up to the islands many times over the years — almost always on day trips,” Sanders’ wife, Jane O’Meara Sanders, told Seven Days in a written statement. “We’ve been impressed with the North Hero community, eaten at the North Hero House and Shore Acres and have suggested them to friends who were looking for a beautiful place to stay or have dinner. St. Anne’s Shrine in Isle La Motte is my favorite church and it is nearby.”Last Tuesday, the day of the closing, a relaxed-looking Bernie Sanders posed for a photo at Hero’s Welcome General Store on Route 2. The store, a bit south of his new abode, serves a sandwich called “Feel the Bun” in the senator’s honor. The $6.99 deli delight consists of a “HUGE” homemade roll, sliced turkey, fresh apple chutney, hot pepper relish, lettuce, tomato and provolone cheese.“It’s not fair that the Billionaire Class controls 99 percent of the bread,” the menu description reads. “Here’s a sandwich for the rest of us … to keep us nourished until everything cool is free!”   ",fake

164,24-Feb-19,"Michigan resident Rob Cortis is without a doubt, one of President Trump’s biggest supporters. Cortis is the creator and owner of the Trump Unity Bridge that’s been traveling across America for the past two years. Rob’s dream is to take his bridge and his message of unity and peace across America to all 48 mainland states. He claims the Pope’s message to President Trump about building bridges instead of walls is what inspired him to build his Unity Bridge. Cortis’ bridge has made its way to some unlikely spots, including Times Square in New York City, Trump’s star along the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and accidentally, smack dab in the middle of the Women’s March in D.C.Cortis makes no bones about it; his Trump Unity Bridge is all about spreading a positive message of peace, unity, and love. Unfortunately, for Rob, the left is not so eager to accept his message. He’s been featured on Fox and Friends, and he’s been a guest at Mar-a-Lago. Cortis can frequently be found at most of Trump’s massive rallies, where he makes it his business to pump up the massive crowd of Trump supporters waiting in line for hours to get the chance to see one of Trump’s historic rallies.Only days before the 2016 election, Trump’s youngest son, Eric, recognized his efforts in a tweet about the Trump Unity Bridge, saying: “Now this is a serious Trump fan! Thank you!!! #FanOfTheDay #Michigan #TrumpBridgeNow this is a serious Trump fan! Thank you!!! #FanOfTheDay #Michigan #TrumpBridge ???????????????????????????????????????????????? pic.twitter.com/uXAFxFYoyI— Eric Trump (@EricTrump) November 4, 2016Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Not everyone, however, is interested in Cortis’ message of unity. To the left, Cortis’ message of unity is about as welcome as an envelope filled with Anthrax. The hilarious video below is a perfect example of how the left is still suffering from the unhealed wounds that still remain, two and a half years after Hillary lost the 2016 presidential election.Watch:The day after bringing the Trump Unity Bridge to D.C. to attend President Trump’s inauguration, Cortis attempted to head out of the city. Unfortunately, for Cortis, he was spotted by a massive group of rabid feminazis and friends, at the Women’s March in D.C., who went out of their way to keep Rob from leaving the D.C. area where they marched. Police escorts and riot police were called in to keep the Trump Unity Bridge moving and keep the passengers safe.The left clearly wasn’t interested in hearing any part of Cortis’ message. Eventually, the crowds of protestors got so big that the riot police had to be called in.This stunning video shows the vitriol and hatred that was spewed at Cortis and his friends as they attempted to pull the Trump Unity Bridge out of D.C. and head back to Michigan. Cortis said later that he was told groups of protesters were tracking his movement and notifying others on his route where he would be next, so they could shut down the roads with human barricades to prevent him from leaving.Watch:In the video below, Rob Cortis can be heard talking to the crowds converging on his Trump Unity Bridge. As the protesters close in on him, Cortis bravely talks to the crowd, telling them, “We all need peace. We all need unity. We all need to come together.” Cortis told them, “We all need to spread unity. We need to spread peace. We have the right for our message to be heard; you have the right for your message to be heard.” Let’s have one America, let’s have one nation…one group of people working together to have a strong nation. We all need to work together.”Rob kicks off his Trump 2020 Unity Bridge Tour across the United States in a couple of weeks. Along the way, he’s passing out Trump hat 2020 bumper stickers, with a focus on college students, although he’ll give them out to anyone who wants to show their support for our President. Pulling his massive float behind him across the United States isn’t cheap, and he relies on donations from Americans who support President Trump and Rob’s message of unity.We’re announcing our support for Rob Cortis and his Trump Unity Bridge today, and we’re asking everyone to consider donating to his GoFundMe account. His goal is $50,000, but it will cost a lot more for Rob to haul his unity float across America.Please consider making a donation to a great cause, and to a great patriot, by clicking HERE.If you have a Tea Party, a pro-Trump or pro-border wall rally, or even a large conservative event,  in any of the 48 mainland states, and you’d like to the Unity Bridge to be there, contact Rob Cortis by clicking  his CONTACT button on his website: RobCortis.comRob Cortis showed up to both of the rallies for Trump’s border wall that we co-hosted in Michigan.

165,23-Feb-19,"ISIS destroyed almost every remnant of Christianity in Iraq.They burned and drowned innocent men alive in cages. They kidnapped women and girls, raped them, and put them in cages. They took to them to market, where they auctioned them off to the highest bidder, where they would become sex slaves and wives for jihadis.They fought against and killed American troops.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Much work remains to be done to keep ISIS from reforming and gaining strength again in the Middle East, but for now, Iraqi residents have been freed from their reign of terror.The final remnants of Islamic State have left the group’s last pocket of territory in eastern Syria – as truckloads of fighters and their jihadi brides are seen being transported from the area.The move came just hours after US-led coalition air strikes intended to pressure the militants targeted the area on the banks of the Euphrates River.At least 36 trucks and two buses were seen leaving the area through a humanitarian corridor from the militants’ last patch of territory in the remote village of Baghouz near the Iraqi border.They were escorted by gun-mounted trucks belonging to the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).As the convoy passed, automatic machine gun fire could be heard in the distance and coalition aircraft flew overhead.According to ABC News– The State Department is saying Muthana was never a U.S. citizen.“Hoda Muthana was not born a U.S. citizen, and she has never been a U.S. citizen,” according to a State Department release.The department said that “there are many reasons that an individual previously issued a passport may subsequently be found ineligible for that passport” and that said passport “may be revoked and/or a renewal application denied.”Muthana was born to a Yemeni diplomat in New Jersey and moved to New York and then Washington, D.C., before finally settling with her family in Alabama as a seventh grader, she said.While children born in America are granted citizenship under the 14th Amendment, children of foreign diplomats are not because they are not under the “jurisdiction of” the U.S., according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Still, children of diplomats can apply for residency and then eventually citizenship, per USCIS.While campaigning for office in 2016, President Trump vowed to decimate ISIS.For over two years, liberals in the media and Democrats openly mocked and rooted against President Trump in his fight against ISIS.Less than 48 hours after Trump was elected, the anti-Trump publication, IBTimes published an article about how ISIS was celebrating the election of Donald Trump:
Supporters of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, celebrated Wednesday the presidential victory of Republican Donald Trump as the beginning of the end of the United States.A number of jihadist commentators and followers of Islamic militant organizations have expressed their praise for the U.S. election results on social media and in online chat rooms. One user, Khorasani, reportedly explained how Trump’s victory, which came after the billionaire openly insulted various minority groups like Muslims, proved the ignorance of the U.S.On July 29, 2018, as they were riding their bikes with two other cyclists in Tajikistan, they were hit by a vehicle and then stabbed to death by members of ISIS.
“You watch the news and you read the papers and you’re led to believe that the world is a big, scary place. People, the narrative goes, are not to be trusted. People are bad. People are evil. People are axe murderers and monsters and worse.I don’t buy it. Evil is a make-believe concept we’ve invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own—it’s easier to dismiss an opinion as abhorrent than strive to understand it. Badness exists, sure, but even that’s quite rare. By and large, humans are kind. Self-interested sometimes, myopic sometimes, but kind. Generous and wonderful and kind. No greater revelation has come from our journey than this.”Austin also had some contemptuous words for President Trump:
On the television across the room, Al Jazeera plays softly. Donald Trump has just announced his plans to move an embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and the Muslim world is visibly upset. Leaving Rabat a week earlier, we’d pedaled right by a massive peaceful demonstration against the relocation. The television broadcasts footage of protests just like that one stewing up all across the Maghreb, the Middle East, and beyond. As a clip plays of a sullen Trump waddling across the screen, I do my best to disappear into the soft plush of the couch cushion behind me. But American as we may be, no one here seems to mind.Nothing says “evil doesn’t exist” like being run down by terrorists and stabbed to death for the crime of riding your bike on the side of the road.What do you think? Is it possible for any president to completely root out Islamic terror groups in the Middle East? Does President Trump’s successful removal of ISIS from Iraq send a strong message to other Islamic terror groups in the Middle East? Share your thoughts with us in the comment section below.",fake

She was asked about farting cows during an appearance on Showtime’s series “Desus and Mero:“In the deal, what we talk about is, it’s true, is that we need to take a look at factory farming, period.

The original document released by Ocasio-Cortez’ office included a statement about “farting cows”.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE LEFT’S OBSESSION WITH METHANE GAS:No more milk and no more chocolate???Somehow, some way, the left always manages to find a way to suck the fun out of just about every aspect of our lives. Whether it’s the chocolate Easter bunny, an iconic symbol of the most important Christian holiday of the year, or simply enjoying a t-bone steak on the grill with a group of friends, there always seems to be some sort of environment danger looming, that’s caused by the intentional bad behavior of humans. According to the left, humans, and not God, are either causing massive swings in the temperature and are constantly being reminded of ways they can eliminate the necessities, as well as the things they enjoy from life to correct their deadly errors.The Washington Times is reporting that consumers need to beware of the chocolate Easter bunny, and those foil-wrapped chocolate eggs. Both could be “bad for the environment” warns a new study, which says that such confections can damage the environment.Researchers at The University of Manchester in England have identified “the carbon footprint of chocolate and its other environmental impacts,” analyzing such factors as ingredients, manufacturing processes, packaging, and waste.Yes, cow gas emissions are cited in the research, which was released Friday.The researchers estimate that the British chocolate industry alone produces about over 2 tons of greenhouse gases a year — as much as a large city.“Most of us love chocolate, but don’t often think of what it takes to get from cocoa beans to the chocolate products we buy,” said Adisa Azapagic, director of Sustainable Industrial Systems and a professor within the School of Chemical Engineering & Analytical Science on the campus.The study noted that cocoa is cultivated in West Africa along with Central and South America, and travels many miles before it reaches a factory and leaving a sizable carbon footprint. Then there is the gas factor.“It’s not only the cocoa — it’s also the milk powder used to make milk chocolates. Its production is very energy intensive, plus dairy cows produce significant greenhouse gas emissions per liter of milk produced. This all adds to the environmental impacts of chocolate,” the study said.",fake

172,21-Feb-19,"Scott Presler is our dear friend, he’s a gay conservative and he’s also one of President Trump’s most loyal supporters. Scott appears on our 100 Percent Fed Up Facebook page in a LIVE video every week to talk about activism and how to get help get Trump re-elected in 2020, to answer questions, and to encourage our 1.7 million followers to get engaged in the political process. Scott Presler is not your typical Republican. He spends most of his day standing on a street corner in Virginia with a speaker and a sign showing his support for President Trump. When he’s not on the street corner, he’s registering voters, sending out free Trump bumper stickers or sending out hand-written notes to thank Americans for their support of our President. In addition to being the most committed Trump supporter you’ll find anywhere in America, he also has the biggest heart, which is why reporting about what happened to Scott, only two days ago, is hard for us to do.Scott was standing on his street corner holding up a pro-Trump sign when three young black men threw something at him from their vehicle. After launching an unknown projectile at Presler, they came back to taunt him, this time on foot. When they confronted Scott, he responded: “If you’re gonna throw things at me, at least do a better job.” Presler asked them, “Why are you attacking a gay man? Why are you attacking a gay Trump supporter?” Presler asked them, saying “I’d like to know.”  One of the young men came face to face with Presler and asked him, “Do you support Trump, for real?” Presler responded, “I sure do. I am a gay man, that supports Trump.” Presler then attempted to explain how President Trump’s U.S. Ambassador Richard Grinnell launched a global campaign to end the decriminalizing homosexuality across the world. As Presler was explaining, one of the young men yelled over him. Scott asked, “Do you think gay people like me should be thrown off of buildings because I was born homosexual?” You can hear the young men laughing at him.  “Okay, so here we have three African-Americans that hate gay people. Interesting…This is the Democrat Party right here guys. This is the Democrat gay hating party,” Presler asked them, “You know I have 268,000 followers [on Twitter] right?  “You guys about to go viral,” Pressler shouted after them as they walked away, “When he gets reelected [Trump] in 2020, I want you to think of me,” as the young punks walked away.In addition to tweeting about the attack, Presler tweeted: I have one last thing to say: While they were throwing up gang signs, I was throwing out facts. Under @realDonaldTrump, black unemployment is at its lowest point in history. President Trump signed criminal justice reform into law. Trump has benefited the black community.Watch the exchange here:I was out with my Trump sign when 3 men threw a projectile at me from their car.

174,21-Feb-19,"The media has literally spent the last two weeks covering the manufactured MAGA hat hate crime against Empire actor Jussie Smollett. They had no video evidence, no witnesses and a “victim” who was unwilling to share his phone records to corroborate his story about being attacked by two white men, wearing Make America Great Again hats, who “dumped bleach” on him, put a “noose around” his neck, shouted racist and homophobic slurs, while adding, “This is MAGA country!”Unfortunately, the Jussie Smollett story provided the media with a much needed anti-Trump shot in the arm. The story came at a critical time, as President Trump was gaining in popularity in the polls, while at the same time, he was exposing Democrat leaders for refusing to fund a wall on our southern border, as a way to keep Americans safe and to protect the jobs of American workers.But what happens when a conservative student is physically attacked and punched in the face by a stranger who doesn’t agree with his political views?  What happens when an innocent student is violently threatened and assaulted by a total stranger, simply for exercising his constitutional right to free speech? Is it okay with the media that this student was attacked on the UC Berkeley campus,  for peacefully recruiting members to join Turning Point USA, a conservative group created for students? What happens when there’s a video to go along with it? If we had a fair-minded media, wouldn’t they want to expose the video to show what happened to this poor conservative kid?So far, the only place you’ll see this disgusting attack on an innocent student is on social media. The student who was attacked in the video is white, he’s a conservative, and he probably supports President Trump. He’s not worthy of media coverage. He’s nothing more than collateral damage in the left’s war on America.Watch the horrific attack here (***WARNING*** Video is graphic)LEFTIST VIOLENCE ON CAMPUS!

176,20-Feb-19,"Los Angeles City Hall was the scene on Monday where Congresswoman Maxine Waters went at it with a lone Trump supporter over the president’s emergency declaration. She made the appearance to address the crowd at the anti-wall protest probably thinking she wouldn’t get push-back from anyone.  Well, she was wrong!Instead, Waters was triggered by a lone brave pro-Trump supporter in the crowd of anti-wall protesters.A man wearing a MAGA hat and waving an American flag was close to Waters who turned and whipped the crowd up against the man.Waters ranted:“This president is trying to keep a campaign promise to all of those people that he swore he would build a wall. And those people who want the wall are not patriots, they’re not people who love this country, they’re not people who stand up for what’s right, and so we’ve got to resist this president and this so-called fake emergency.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The protester got near Waters and disrupted her rant, and then someone tried to grab a flag the man was carrying.The ironic thing is that someone yelled “fascist” at the lone protester. They need to get a Websters and look up the word “fascist.”The MAGA hat-wearing man yelled out: “America!”Waters proceeded to try and get the crowd chanting: “Stop this fake president!”The crowd taunted the man as police moved him away from Waters.Waters chanted: “He’s confused.”Finally, a Waters supporter yelled out a vulgar phrase: “Go f*ck yourself!” and then someone took his hat.Who is the fascist in this situation? It would be Waters and the angry crowd who can’t accept anyone with a difference of opinion.Maxine Waters is the new Chair of the Financial Services Committee in Congress. It’s a result of the Republican loss in Congress in the midterms last year. Elections have consequences and the consequence of having someone like Waters in such an important position is frightening.LISTEN TO WHAT SHE PROMISED IF SHE WAS PLACED IN THE FSC CHAIR POSITION AGAIN:“Impeach Trump” Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) is about to assume a very powerful role as the House Financial Services Committee. Even before she assumes her role, Maxine has alreaday begun threatening the banks, telling them, “I’m gonna do to you what you did to us!”In 2012, when Maxine Waters was about to assume the role as chairwoman on the House Financial Services Committee, Judicial Watch wrote a scathing condemnation of the Democrats decision to place her in that powerful role, yet again:A famously corrupt—and seemingly untouchable—congresswoman renowned for abusing her power to enrich family members is set to hold a ranking position on the powerful House committee that oversees the nation’s financial services industries.Even for Washington this is a bit much. Democrats have chosen a scandal-plagued college, veteran Congresswoman Maxine Waters, to be the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee despite her many transgressions over the years. The influential congresswoman has helped family members make more than $1 million through business ventures with companies and causes that she has helped, according to her hometown newspaper.A few years ago Waters was investigated by the House Ethics Committee for steering $12 million in federal bailout funds to a failing Massachusetts bank (that subsequently got shut down by the government) in which she and her board member husband held shares. Read all about it in Waters’ profile on Judicial Watch’s 2011 “Ten Most Wanted Corrupt Politicians.” list.Well, it looks like history is about to repeat itself, again, as Maxine Waters is set to assume the role as chairwoman again in 2019.The video below shows Maxine Waters just before the midterm elections, and a flashback video to the time when Maxine Waters openly admitted her desire for a Socialist form of government in the United States during a 2009 House hearing, stating that her goal was to see a government takeover of all of the oil companies in America.‘I will be the first African-American, the first woman to chair the powerful financial services committee. That’s all of Wall Street, that’s all the insurance companies, that’s all the banks. And so, of course, the CEO’s of the banks now are saying, ‘What can we do to stop Maxine Waters? Because if she gets in, she’s gonna give us a bad time.’ What am I gonna do to you? I’m gonna do to you what is fair—I’m gonna do to you what you did to us.”Watch:Here we go… pic.twitter.com/Ax7pPkzW3r— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) December 2, 2018The Washington Times reports- Waters is no friend to the nation’s biggest banks and Wall Street, and has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and his administration. The congresswoman from California has called for more regulation of banks, and has opposed Trump’s political appointees moving to roll back regulations on banks and other financial services companies.For example, Waters, along with several other Democrats, were “no” votes on a banking industry bill that rolled back several parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the law passed under President Barack Obama that more tightly regulated banks after the financial crisis. In the Senate, the bill was supported by several Democrats and was signed into law this summer by Trump.With a Republican-controlled Senate and Trump in the White House, it is unlikely Waters‘ proposed regulations on banks will make it into law. However, it’s also much less likely that any substantial new deregulatory bills get through, either.But there are things that will be outside of the control of Waters and congressional Democrats. Most banking laws give the regulators who oversee the industry – the Federal Reserve, CFPB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others – wide authority to tailor regulations as needed. Nearly all of the positions at those regulators are now filled by Trump appointees. –In August 2010, an investigative subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee issued a Statement of Alleged Violation charging Rep. Waters with three counts of violating House rules and ethics regulations in connection with her actions regarding OneUnited.From the Citizens for Ethics – In the midst of a national financial catastrophe, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) used her position as a senior member of Congress and member of the House Financial Services Committee to prevail upon Treasury officials to meet with OneUnited Bank.  She never disclosed that her husband held stock in the bank.  This outrageous conduct has led Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) to include the congresswoman as one of the Most Corrupt Members of Congress. Rep. Waters has close financial ties to OneUnited Bank, one of the largest black-owned banks in the country. In March 2004, she and her husband, Sidney Williams, each separately bought OneUnited stock worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Additionally, Mr. Williams maintained separate holdings at OneUnited worth between $250,001 and $500,000. In September 2004, Rep. Waters sold her stock in OneUnited, and her husband sold a portion of his valued between $250,001 and $500,000. That same year, Mr. Williams joined the bank’s board, a position he retained until April 21, 2008. In addition, Mr. Williams owned 3,500 shares of OneUnited preferred stock and 476 shares of the bank’s common stock, the value of which was approximately $350,000 in June 2008. If OneUnited failed, the stock would have been worthless.On or about September 8, 2008, Rep. Waters asked then-Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson to hold a meeting with minority-owned banks to discuss losses they suffered after the government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship.10 The subsequent September 9th meeting included several senior Treasury officials, but representatives of just a single bank – OneUnited. One attendee, OneUnited’s senior counsel Robert Cooper, was then also the incoming chair of the National Bankers Association (NBA), a trade association representing minority-owned banks. Rep. Waters’ chief of staff and grandson, Mikael Moore, also attended.Kevin Cohee, chief executive officer of OneUnited, and Mr. Cooper used the meeting as an opportunity to request bailout funds.14 In a subsequent email, Mr. Cooper specifically requested more than $40 million from Treasury to compensate the bank for losses.15 At the time, the department lacked the legislative authority to bail out the bank.16 Former Bush White House officials said they were surprised when OneUnited officials asked for bailout funds because they understood the meeting had been arranged to discuss the losses minority-owned banks endured when the federal government took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.In December 2008, Rep. Waters intervened again, asking Treasury to host another meeting to ensure minority-owned banks received part of the $700 billion allocated under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The second meeting focused on minority-owned banks in general, though a OneUnited official was present. On December 19, 2008, OneUnited secured $12.1 million in bailout funds.Rep. Waters did not disclose her financial ties to OneUnited to Treasury officials when she requested meetings between regulators and bank officials. A former Bush administration official who helped set up the initial meeting stated, “[Learning of the connection] was upsetting to me. This is something that was potentially politically explosive and embarrassing to the administration. They should have at least let us know.” Treasury officials claimed that although OneUnited also requested a meeting with regulators regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac losses, it was not until the congresswoman intervened that the Treasury Department approved the initial meeting.Further, sometime in early September 2008, around the same time Rep. Waters asked the Treasury Department to hold the initial meeting, Rep. Waters spoke to Rep. Barney Frank (D- MA) about OneUnited and the fact that Mr. Williams previously had served on the board. Rep. Frank advised her to stay out of matters related to OneUnited because of her husband’s ties to the bank. Nevertheless, despite Rep. Frank’s advice, Mr. Moore continued to actively assist OneUnited representatives in their quest to receive bailout funds, and worked to craft legislation authorizing Treasury to grant OneUnited’s request.Rep. Waters defended her actions, claiming the NBA had asked her to request the initial meeting with Treasury, and she released a letter from Mr. Cooper. Neither the former chairman nor the president of the NBA, however, had been aware of Mr. Cooper’s letter, and the organization began an internal investigation.“By contacting then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to request a meeting, allegedly for a group of minority-owned banks, but then arranging for only one bank – OneUnited, in which she had a financial interest – to attend, Rep. Waters violated House conflict of interest rules,” said CREW Executive Director Melanie Sloan. – Citizens For Ethics",fake
177,20-Feb-19,"Like a true socialist, Sanders doesn’t sacrifice much in his own life, however. The lifetime politician owns three homes—one of them is located on the prestigious shores of the Champlain Islands, in Vermont.Immediately after Sanders agreed to endorse his opponent, Hillary Clinton, the Burlington resident plopped down nearly $600,000 for the lakefront home.Sanders’ lakefront crib has four bedrooms and 500 feet of Lake Champlain beachfront on the east side of the island — facing Vermont, not New York. The Bern will keep his home in Burlington and use the new camp seasonally.Besides having an incredibly superior lifestyle to most Americans, the socialist Senator who just announced he’ll be taking another shot at becoming president in 2020, also has a reputation for being lazy.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]According to Washington Free Beacon – in 1971, Bernie Sanders was asked to leave a hippie commune for “sitting around and talking” about politics instead of working, according to a forthcoming book.We Are As Gods by Kate Daloz, scheduled for release April 26, chronicles the rise and fall of the Myrtle Hill Farm in northeast Vermont. Daloz, a Brooklyn writer, was in a special position to write a history of Myrtle Hill: she was raised near the commune in a geodesic dome residence with an outhouse called the Richard M. Nixon Memorial Hall. Her parents were close acquaintances of the commune residents, who offered them tips about wilderness living.In 1971, when a young Bernie Sanders heard news of the first baby born at a recently established Vermont commune, he rushed over to interview the mother. In a simply designed outbuilding, with the help of the communards’ all-night chanting and a midwife, the woman had given birth to a daughter who claimed no father in particular but rather belonged to the commune as a whole. Kate Daloz’s fascinating, well-told exploration of the 1970s back-to-the-land movement, We Are As Gods, details the encounter, as Sanders gathered information for an article he was writing about home births: “As Loraine nursed Rahula in the Star House, he gently peppered her with questions in his thick Brooklyn accent. Loraine was happy to oblige. She liked Bernie and appreciated his thoughtful interest in her experience.” It was the beginning of a lifelong connection — over the next several decades, whenever the two would meet, Sanders would ask after her daughter. Other members, however, were not so welcoming of the future presidential candidate, put off by Sanders’ “penchant for sitting around and talking about ideas when there was so much work to be done.”During labor, Loraine said she was surrounded by a circle of hippies chanting “a meditation mancha” that “seemed to really bring in good energy.” This group included “the couple of men who were potentially the baby’s father,” according to Deloz. When Rahula was delivered at dawn, “someone ran out into the field and blew a long blast on a hunting horn.” Loraine then ate her afterbirth, a detail that does not appear in the book, but that appeared in the second part of Sanders’ essay.When not reporting on the miracle of life, Sanders spent his time at Myrtle Hill in “endless political discussion,” according to Deloz.Sanders’ idle chatter did not endear him with some of the commune’s residents, who did the backbreaking labor of running the place. Daloz writes that one resident, Craig, “resented feeling like he had to pull others out of Bernie’s orbit if any work was going to get accomplished that day.”Sanders was eventually asked to leave. “When Bernie had stayed for Myrtle’s allotted three days, Craig politely requested that he move on,” Daloz writes.",fake
178,19-Feb-19,"Bernie Sanders just announced he’s running for president again.He was interviewed today bragging about how the Democrats have adopted his radical views:“I can tell you very happily, and I think any objective observer would confirm what I’m saying, is that in the last year and half or so, the Democratic Party has moved in a far more progressive direction than they were before I ran for president.”Years ago, Sanders would straddle the fence on declaring his socialist roots but now he’s full-on proud of the far-left shift by Democrats.His email to supporters today said it all in a nutshell:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial, and environmental justice.”In 1985, Sanders was captured on video saying breadlines are a ‘good thing’.“You know, it’s funny, sometimes American journalists talk about how bad a country is because people are lining up for food,” Sanders said. “That’s a good thing. In other countries, people don’t line up for food. The rich get the food, and the poor starve to death.”Sanders talks about transformation for America. Sound familiar? Remember the “fundamental transformation” Obama promised? America rejected that in 2016 when they elected Trump.No Socialism for America!",fake

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2019 The  video and transcript of the exchange between CBS’ Scott Pelley and McCabe are below:Scott Pelley: What was it specifically that caused you to launch the counterintelligence investigation?Andrew McCabe: It’s many of those same concerns that cause us to be concerned about a national security threat. And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia’s malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, “Why would a president of the United States do that?” So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?Scott Pelley: Are you saying that the president is in league with the Russians?Andrew McCabe: I’m saying that the FBI had reason to investigate that. Right, to investigate the existence of an investigation doesn’t mean someone is guilty. I would say, Scott, if we failed to open an investigation, under those circumstances, we wouldn’t be doing our jobs.Scott Pelley: When you decided to launch these two investigations, was the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, onboard with that.Andrew McCabe: Absolutely.Rod Rosenstein has spent 28 years at the Department of Justice. A Republican, he was appointed by President Trump as deputy attorney general, number two at the department. Mr. Trump’s firing of James Comey on May 9, 2017, set off a week of crisis meetings between Rosenstein, who was in charge of the Russia investigation and acting FBI director Andrew McCabe.Andrew McCabe: I can’t describe to you accurately enough the pressure and the chaos that Rod and I were trying to operate under at that time. It was incredibly turbulent, incredibly stressful. And it was clear to me that that stress was— was impacting the deputy attorney general. We talked about why the president had insisted on firing the director and whether or not he was thinking about the Russia investigation and did that impact his decision. And in the context of that conversation, the deputy attorney general offered to wear a wire into the White House. He said, “I never get searched when I go into the White House. I could easily wear a recording device. They wouldn’t know it was there.” Now, he was not joking.  He was absolutely serious. And in fact, he brought it up in the next meeting we had. I never actually considered taking him up on the offer. I did discuss it with my general counsel and my leadership team back at the FBI after he brought it up the first time.Scott Pelley: The point of Rosenstein wearing the wire into a meeting with the president was what? What did he hope to obtain?Andrew McCabe: I can’t characterize what Rod was thinking or what he was hoping at that moment. But the reason you would have someone wear a concealed recording device would be to collect evidence and in this case, what was the true nature of the president’s motivation in calling for the firing of Jim Comey?Scott Pelley: The general counsel of the FBI and the leadership team you spoke with said what about this idea?Andrew McCabe: I think the general counsel had a heart attack. And when he got up off the floor, he said, “I, I, that’s a bridge too far. We’re not there yet.”Scott Pelley: That it wasn’t necessary at that point in the investigation to escalate it to that level.Andrew McCabe: That’s correct.But McCabe says Rosenstein raised another idea. The 25th Amendment to the constitution allows the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to remove the president.Andrew McCabe: Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply, Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort. I didn’t have much to contribute, to be perfectly honest, in that— conversation. So I listened to what he had to say. But, to be fair, it was an unbelievably stressful time. I can’t even describe for you how many things must have been coursing through the deputy attorney general’s mind at that point. So it was really something that he kinda threw out in a very frenzied chaotic conversation about where we were and what we needed to do next.Scott Pelley: What seemed to be coursing through the mind of the deputy attorney general was getting rid of the president of the United StatesAndrew McCabe: Well—Pelley: One way or another.Andrew McCabe: I can’t confirm that. But what I can say is the deputy attorney general was definitely very concerned about the president, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.Scott Pelley: How did he bring up the idea of the 25th amendment to you?Andrew McCabe: Honestly, I don’t remember. He, it was just another kinda topic that he jumped to in the midst of a wide-ranging conversation.Scott Pelley: Seriously? (LAUGH) Just—Andrew McCabe: Yeah—Scott Pelley: —another topicAndrew McCabe: Yeah.Scott Pelley: Did you counsel him on that?Andrew McCabe: I didn’t. I mean, he was discussing other cabinet members and whether or not people would support such an idea, whether or not other cabinet members would share, his belief that the president was — was really concerning, was concerning Rod at that time.Scott Pelley: Rosenstein was actually openly talking about whether there was a majority of the cabinet who would vote to remove the president.Andrew McCabe: That’s correct. Counting votes or possible votes.Scott Pelley: Did he assign specific votes to specific people?Andrew McCabe: No, not that I recall.Scott Pelley: As you’re sitting in this meeting in the Justice Department, talking about removing the president of the United States, you were thinking what?Andrew McCabe: How did I get here? Confronting these confounding legal issues of such immense importance, not just to the FBI but to the entire country, it was— it was disorienting.President Trump is correct…Deranged",fake

We talked about why the president had insisted on firing the director and whether or not he was thinking about the Russia investigation and did that impact his decision. And in the context of that conversation, the deputy attorney general offered to wear a wire into the White House. He said, “I never get searched when I go into the White House. I could easily wear a recording device. They wouldn’t know it was there.” Now, he was not joking.  He was absolutely serious. And in fact, he brought it up in the next meeting we had. I never actually considered taking him up on the offer. I did discuss it with my general counsel and my leadership team back at the FBI after he brought it up the first time.Scott Pelley: The point of Rosenstein wearing the wire into a meeting with the president was what? What did he hope to obtain?Andrew McCabe: I can’t characterize what Rod was thinking or what he was hoping at that moment. But the reason you would have someone wear a concealed recording device would be to collect evidence and in this case, what was the true nature of the president’s motivation in calling for the firing of Jim Comey?Scott Pelley: The general counsel of the FBI and the leadership team you spoke with said what about this idea?Andrew McCabe: I think the general counsel had a heart attack. And when he got up off the floor, he said, “I, I, that’s a bridge too far. We’re not there yet.”Scott Pelley: That it wasn’t necessary at that point in the investigation to escalate it to that level.Andrew McCabe: That’s correct.But McCabe says Rosenstein raised another idea. The 25th Amendment to the constitution allows the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to remove the president.Andrew McCabe: Discussion of the 25th Amendment was simply, Rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort. I didn’t have much to contribute, to be perfectly honest, in that— conversation. So I listened to what he had to say. But, to be fair, it was an unbelievably stressful time. I can’t even describe for you how many things must have been coursing through the deputy attorney general’s mind at that point. So it was really something that he kinda threw out in a very frenzied chaotic conversation about where we were and what we needed to do next.Scott Pelley: What seemed to be coursing through the mind of the deputy attorney general was getting rid of the president of the United StatesAndrew McCabe: Well—Pelley: One way or another.Andrew McCabe: I can’t confirm that. But what I can say is the deputy attorney general was definitely very concerned about the president, about his capacity, and about his intent at that point in time.Scott Pelley: How did he bring up the idea of the 25th amendment to you?Andrew McCabe: Honestly, I don’t remember. He, it was just another kinda topic that he jumped to in the midst of a wide-ranging conversation.Scott Pelley: Seriously? (LAUGH) Just—Andrew McCabe: Yeah—Scott Pelley: —another topicAndrew McCabe: Yeah.Scott Pelley: Did you counsel him on that?Andrew McCabe: I didn’t. I mean, he was discussing other cabinet members and whether or not people would support such an idea, whether or not other cabinet members would share, his belief that the president was — was really concerning, was concerning Rod at that time.Scott Pelley: Rosenstein was actually openly talking about whether there was a majority of the cabinet who would vote to remove the president.Andrew McCabe: That’s correct. Counting votes or possible votes.Scott Pelley: Did he assign specific votes to specific people?Andrew McCabe: No, not that I recall.Scott Pelley: As you’re sitting in this meeting in the Justice Department, talking about removing the president of the United States, you were thinking what?Andrew McCabe: How did I get here? Confronting these confounding legal issues of such immense importance, not just to the FBI but to the entire country, it was— it was disorienting.President Trump is correct…Deranged",fake

And the idea is, if the president committed obstruction of justice, fired the director of the of the FBI to negatively impact or to shut down our investigation of Russia’s malign activity and possibly in support of his campaign, as a counterintelligence investigator you have to ask yourself, “Why would a president of the United States do that?” So all those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and our most fearsome enemy, the government of Russia?Scott Pelley: Are you saying that the president is in league with the Russians?Andrew McCabe: I’m saying that the FBI had reason to investigate that. Right, to investigate the existence of an investigation doesn’t mean someone is guilty. I would say, Scott, if we failed to open an investigation, under those circumstances, we wouldn’t be doing our jobs.Scott Pelley: When you decided to launch these two investigations, was the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, onboard with that.Andrew McCabe: Absolutely.Rod Rosenstein has spent 28 years at the Department of Justice.

182,17-Feb-19,"The local CBS News is reporting a new twist in the Empire star Jussie Smollett’s hate hoax attack. Several new items of information have been revealed that further incriminate ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett. The latest report shows just how involved the three men were in executing the hate hoax where Smollett claimed two men yelled: “This is MAGA country!”The Nigerian brothers, Abimbola ‘Abel’ and Olabinjo ‘Ola’ Osundairo, are telling police officers that Smollett paid them $3,500 to commit the hate hoax and then would pay them another $500 upon their return from Nigeria to the US. They are also saying that the hate hoax was rehearsed.CBS News reports:Sources said one of the brothers held the rope and poured bleach while the other wore a plain red hat and yelled slurs at Smollett.The sources say the red hat was bought at an Uptown beauty supply store and that the attack was supposed to happen before Jan. 29. The brothers told detectives the three men rehearsed the attack days prior to it happening.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The rope used in the attack was purchased at a local hardware store by the brothers.The Chicago police gathered evidence (see below) that included many of the items reportedly used in the attack including a red hate, bleach and a rope.The Chicago police and FBI continue to investigate who sent threatening letters to Smollett eight days before the attack happened:TMZ reports:When police raided the home of the 2 brothers they found magazines with pages torn out, and authorities are now trying to determine if the missing pages are connected to the threatening letter that was sent to Jussie 8 days before the alleged attack. This could produce another twist in the story that’s been in the national spotlight for weeks.Smollett hired a criminal defense attorney to represent him. The attorney has already released a statement defending Smollett:“As a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with. He has now been further victimized by claims attributed to these alleged perpetrators that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.“One of these purported suspects was Jussie’s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie’s complicity.The Nigerian brothers are living at an undisclosed location while police continue to investigate this hate hoax.The Chicago police continue to investigate the crime where the victim could become the suspect.CBS’ Brad Edwards reports:TOP SOURCE: “… indicators point to Smollett orchestrating the event ….” @cbschicago pic.twitter.com/t3T5kQmeko— Brad Edwards (@tvbrad) February 15, 2019“ORCHESTRATED BY THE ACTOR”Chicago’s CBS2 reports:Two sources with intimate knowledge of the investigation tell CBS 2 Investigator Brad Edwards the attack on Smollett was potentially orchestrated by the actor himself and involved the two other men.TWO NIGERIAN MEN:BREAKING:Police raided the home of two persons of interest in Jussie Smollett case last night.

Wallace was insufferable because he constantly interrupted Miller during the interview.Miller stood his ground on President Trump’s national emergency declaration. He said President Trump plans on building a “couple hundred miles of border wall by 2020”:“You’re going to see probably a couple hundred miles in time; I would say, by the end of the next appropriation cycle. All together in terms of what we already have underway, what’s underway right now, and then what we’re going to complete.”“THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO PROTECT HIS NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“Obviously, the president is going to protect his national emergency declaration.

184,16-Feb-19,"New information coming from Chicago police sources suggests that ‘Empire’ actor Jussie Smollett orchestrated the attack he claimed was carried out by two men who yelled: “This is MAGA country!”.The CPD has asked to interview Smollett again after they arrested and then released two Nigerian brothers. Sources say that the brothers flipped on Smollett when they were threatened with being charged with battery. As it turns out, Chicago police discovered that the brothers bought the rope used to make a noose that was placed on Smollett’s neck at some point on the night of the supposed attack.  They told police officers that they purchased the rope at Ace Hardware in Chicago.Chicago (CBS) — Two brothers who were questioned and released by Chicago police investigating the Jussie Smollett attack did play a role in the crime.Sources say at least one of the brothers bought the rope used in the incident at Smollett’s request. The sources also say the “Empire” actor paid for the rope, which was purchased at the Crafty Beaver Hardware Store the weekend of Jan. 25.They left for Nigeria later in the day on Jan. 29 after the attack.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Smollett claims two men attacked him in Streeterville early Jan. 29 as he was heading to his apartment. He said they yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, poured a chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.WATCH:As with any police investigation of a crime, it’s always best to allow the detectives to do their job and then report or remark on the findings of their investigation. Of course, all of those rules go out the window when there’s a possibility the crime could be tied to President Trump or to his supporters. If there’s a chance the crime has a hint of being tied to either President Trump or his signature MAGA hat, all bets are off—especially for Democrat presidential hopefuls, who want you to believe they are thinking individuals with the ability to make rational judgment calls when necessary.On Jan 29, 2019, almost every single 2020 presidential candidate came forward on Twitter to bravely condemn the racist, homophobic, lynching, hate crime committed against the Empire actor Jussie Smollett (that we all now know was a hoax).Joe Biden, without any knowledge of whether or not what Smollett was saying was true, tweeted, ” What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor;”Biden continued: that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.”Are you with him now, Joe? Now that he’s wasted multiple hours of the Chicago Police Department’s much-needed officers and created a hateful narrative that pitted Americans against each other over a LIE—what do you have to say now, Joe?“Spartacus” Booker, another 2020 presidential hopeful, who has problems himself with being caught lying about imaginary friends, as a way to evoke sympathy and emotion from others, tweeted: The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching. I’m glad he’s safe.Was Smollett actually “lynched?” Did we miss something in the reporting?Booker continued: “To those in Congress who don’t feel the urgency to pass our Anti-Lynching bill designating lynching as a federal hate crime- I urge you to pay attention.It’s ironic that a black Democrat is using a faked attempted lynching by another black Democrat to call on lawmakers to make lynching a federal crime. It’s also curious that Booker’s behaving as though lynchings are happening with alarming frequency in America. It’s almost as though he’s referring to the days when the Democrat-founded KKK members were actually committing lynchings.Democrat presidential hopeful, Kamala Harris remarked about what a kind and gentle human being Jussie Smollett is, and how she’s praying for his quick recovery. Kamala continued, without any evidence to back up her hysterical claim, ” This was an attempted modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color of their skin. We must confront this hate.Okay, Kamala…those are some pretty strong words. Now that you know it was all a hoax, are you planning to confront “one of the kindest and most gentle human beings” you know and ask him why he lied about the white Trump supporters, who screamed, “This is MAGA country!”?And then the angry Socialist chimed in. Socialist-Democrat Independent 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders tweeted as though the Smollett investigation was already complete, saying, “The racist and homophobic attack on Jussie Smollett is a horrific instance of the surging hostility toward minorities around the country.”“Surging hostilities toward minorities in this country”??? Do you have any facts to back up your claim, you old curmudgeon?Democrat Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, the woman who is third in line for the presidency has no time to wait for the results of a silly criminal investigation, Pelosi went all out in her call to end “this hate once and for all” following her accusation of a “racist and homophobic attack on @JussieSmollett”https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1090439686504570885Of course, a few of the Democrat freshmen sensations, the queen of hate, Rashida Tlaib and the dumbest woman in Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez felt the need to weigh in on the Smollett investigation, by condemning the attackers before the results of the crime were even released.The angry Palestinian-American Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) tweeted: “When one of the most famous black and gay men in America is not safe the message is clearer than it ever has been.”The dangerous lies spewing from the right wing is killing and hurting our people.”So…now that we all know the lie was from “one of the most famous black and gay men in America” who is also a vocal critic of President Trump, just like you, Rashida Tlaib, what do you have to say for yourself now?America will wait for your apology.From the “New Green Deal” and 25,000 jobs killing freshman Congresswoman, Socialist-Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez:There is no such thing as “racially charged.” This attack was not “possibly” homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack. If you don’t like what’s happening in this country, then work to change it. It is no one’s job to water-down or sugar coat the rise in hate crimes.Tell us Alexandria…could you please tell us exactly who is responsible for the “racist and homophobic attack” you were so sure happened to Smollett?We’ll also wait for your apology.Andy Ngo does a great job of listing all of the ridiculous and hate-filled tweets against conservatives, President Trump and his supporters. Ngo also retweets a very telling tweet from the unhinged actor Jussie Smollett to President Trump:Shut the hell up you bitch ass nigga. You will continue to run this country further into the ground and risk lives every time you breathe. You’re not the president. Just a dumpster full of hate. FOH.

And finally, “Think Progress” who likes to think of themselves as important journalism, admonishes the White House and top Republicans for their silence over the MAGA hat attackers. And then there’s the Mercury News, who mocked Donald Trump Jr. for “believing the Empire star’s attack was a hoax”Bay-area reporter @marthajross actually wrote this news article for @mercnews saying that it was a “conspiracy theory” to doubt Smollett’s sensational claims.

I mean she was right here next to me.” Conway pointed to show that her daughter was standing directly next to her. She continued, “Somebody was grabbing me from behind, grabbed my arms and was shaking me, to the point that I thought maybe somebody was hugging me, one of the other parents coming to pick up his or her daughter…and then as I turned around, it just felt weird, I felt like well, that’s a little aggressive.”Conway explained that as she turned around and faced the stranger attacking her at the restaurant, she could see that the woman was “just unhinged.” Conway to Bash, “She was out of control. I don’t even know how to explain it to you. Her whole face was terror and anger and just—” Conway pointed to her face, saying, “She was right here.”According to the Daily Mail– The woman who presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway says physically assaulted her in October is married to the CEO of a $43 million environmental charity and manages volunteers for a nonprofit that boasts ’empathy’ as ‘a priority skill’ for ‘living and working together in this radically different world.’Beth Inabinett, 63, is being ID’d for the first time.

196,10-Feb-19,"Only three weeks after President Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, Ed Pilkington of The Guardian wrote a grotesque hit piece on voters in Macomb County, MI. In his article, Pilkington suggests the reason Macomb County citizens overwhelmingly voted for President Trump after voting for Barack Obama twice, is because they’re not listening to the left-wing media.Pilkington starts his article:Pinkerton’s article begins by laying out the liberal media’s dramatic, exaggerated and mostly untrue talking points about Trump.Trump has proclaimed war on the media, was accused of serial lying, declared open season on environmentalists and undocumented immigrants, outraged the Mexican president, begun stripping millions of Americans of healthcare coverage, and revived the prospect of torturing terror suspects. The pugnacity of his pronouncements has left even Trump-hardened observers aghast, prompting speculation that such an adrenaline-charged opening to his term couldn’t possibly be sustained.Tell that to the people of Macomb County in Michigan.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“Thank the Lord for Donald Trump!” exclaimed the waitress in Angelo’s diner when asked how she thought he was doing. “He’s awesome, he’s great,” said the car worker. “I absolutely love him,” the window cleaner said. “I’m 100% for Trump,” the pawn shop owner said.Then there is how residents of Macomb County, an overwhelmingly white working-class suburb of Detroit, see their new commander-in-chief. It is as if all the raging controversy of the week had somehow washed off him on the 600-mile journey from Washington to Michigan, leaving a cleansed and beatific Trump committed to creating jobs and putting America first.Niel Redmond, 54, a mechanic who in 2012 voted for Barack Obama but this time went for Trump, said: “I think he’s doing a phenomenal job.”Pilkerton’s next target is Wallace Kotharz, a strong Trump supporter who calls him the “greatest president for jobs that God ever created”. Kotharz cites Carrier and the Keystone Pipeline as examples of Trump’s successes.The Guardian writer desperately attempts to diminish every one of the Trump supporters by suggesting they just don’t read enough because, if they did, they would surely hate President Trump as much as he does. He goes out of his way to create an image of the Macomb County Trump supporters as a bunch of uneducated bufoons, blaming their ignorance on their refusal to trust the media to tell them the truth about Trump.What makes someone like the chief reporter for the far left Guardian want to travel to the blue-collar county in Michigan when so many other counties across America flipped for Trump in 2016? Perhaps it’s because the Democrat Party knows that the road to the White House is likely running through Macomb County, MI.President Trump knew the importance of sharing his plans for bringing back jobs to America with Macomb County residents. Only two days before the election, Trump made one last stop in Sterling Heights, MI, the center of Macomb County, hoping to convince voters in the Democrat stronghold to support him on election day. It was in Sterling Heights, where he accurately predicted a “Brexit”-style election win, referring to when the United Kingdom voters defied pre-election polling numbers and opted to leave the European Union.Trump won Macomb County, MI with 54 % of the vote to Hillary’s 42%. Gary Johnson got 3% of the vote.Yesterday, 100 Percent Fed Up and Jazmine Early, a legal immigrant from Columbia, sponsored a rally for Trump’s border wall in Sterling Heights, MI.Mark Forton, a retired auto factory worker, who is now the Macomb County GOP Chair was also present at the rally. Forton, a huge President Trump supporter, asked if could tell me about some exciting news he was bringing back from the Macomb County GOP convention? Besides bickering, I wasn’t convinced anything coming out of the local Republican convention could be considered exciting, but I agreed to meet with Mark to hear what he had to say.After standing outside for over two hours during the rally in single-digit temperatures including the wind chill factor, I agreed to meet Mark for a cup of hot chocolate in the Country Cabin Restuarant. (It should be noted, that the owners of the restaurant enthusiastically agreed to allow our pro-Trump, pro-border wall supporters use their restrooms and come inside to thaw out during our rally.) As it turns out, the Macomb County GOP Chair did have some very exciting news to share. Forton explained that on February 7, they held their County Convention, where delegates and alternates are elected to the State Convention. The GOP Chair explained how he threw a wrench into what should have been a ho-hum procedural meeting. Before the convention, the GOP Chair asked for time to deliver a report to the members. He explained that this not customarily done at conventions, but said, “there is no rule saying that you cannot do it.”The difference of 48,348 votes was enough to swing Michigan for Trump.Statewide, voters chose Trump by just 13,107 votes.Macomb County voters favored Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008 and again in 2012. Before that, in 2004, the county narrowly chose George W. Bush as president.About 82 percent of Macomb County residents are white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the rate of people 25 years or older with a bachelor’s degree or above is 23 percent.Both campaigns passed through Macomb County, but Trump’s team appeared to give it more attention down the stretch. ",fake

I’m sure they can find numerous people who want that seat in that district.”The 29-year-old congressperson noted (accurately) that it’s generally expected that New York will likely lose a seat, despite the city itself growing at a consistent pace. “I don’t know if that means that all of our districts are going to be redrawn dramatically, because they have been historically gerrymandered, or what will happen, but there’s certainly a possibility, if not a guarantee, that my district in the coming years will not look like my district today,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “So I think it’s entirely possible, and New York politics being what it is, we have no idea where things are going to go.”On the Republican side, the wildly popular gay hairdresser, Brandon Straka, who founded the #WalkAway movement that encouraged Democrats to leave their intolerant, plantation Party and support President Trump is considering running against Ocasio-Cortez. ",fake

At the top of the ad is the quote drawing so much attention: “Heaven has a wall, a gate, and a strict immigration policy. Hell has open borders. Let that sink in.”Dozens of people have since called out the store for the circular, with some calling it “disgusting” message, vowing to no longer shop there.KALB reached out to Mac’s Fresh Market owner Reggy McDaniel, who said it’s about faith for him.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“That’s my meaning of the whole thing is are people prepared to go to heaven or are they not,” said McDaniel. “I thought it was a perfect time because everybody is talking about the border, some people want it, some don’t want us to have one. The only thing I was shocked about was that it’s racist. I have never in my life been accused of being a racist, I’m 70 years old I haven’t evolved into one.”“If I used a political message and I’m very aware it’s political, to highlight Jesus Christ, then I’m guilty of it,” said McDaniel.Others on social media choosing to boycott the store saying “I’ll no longer shop in your store” and “I will no longer spend money on any of your products.”“Karen Webre” defended the owner’s remarks: It’s a great statement and he has freedom of speech . Nothing racial or politically correct about it .. just a fact . Way to go Macs fresh market !“Michael Hoffman” threatened to boycott the store, calling the owners behavior “racist?”For the record, Michael, illegal immigration is not a race.“I appreciate them shopping with me, but this is America they have the privilege of shopping where they want to,” McDaniel said. “All I can do is tell them my case if they want to describe me in some kind of way that I am someone who is not worthy to shop with, I’d be shocked.”McDaniel said he will continue to put messages on his ad mailers in the future.",fake

Sure, just like Pelosi’s sincerity when she was pretending to read from some papers during the president’s speech?The behavior from Pelosi was childish and petty. What’s even worse is she’s running around mocking the clap with Hollywood celebrities. What a poor excuse for a  leader.We know it was intended as a slight to President Trump. Pelosi’s own daughter acknowledged it was a slight and said it brought her back to high school with her mom.Social media grabbed onto this repeat of the rude clap and hammered away at Speaker Pelosi:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The rude clap was celebrated by the left after Pelosi did it on the night of the SOTU but it didn’t overshadow the excellent speech by President Trump.

Spokespeople for both Schiff and Simpson played the meeting off like it was no big deal and only a short social encounter. Funny, that’s what Clinton and Lynch said of their tarmac meeting.This is a double standard by Schiff because he previously demanded Rep.

204,08-Feb-19,"Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was fantastic today during the hearing before the Judiciary Committee! He took all of the slings and arrows from Democrats and came out looking like a winner. The Democrats all looked petty and angry.One of the best moments of the day had to be when Whitaker mocked showboating Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler.

Each one of the members of the Judiciary Committee had the chance to do their best to humiliate Acting AG Whitaker to get their soundbite on the nightly news.The best part about the ridiculous grandstanding was the push back from Whitaker. He was fantastic! Rep. Doug Collins was also pushing back hard on the Democrats as you’ll see in the video below. The ridiculous thing is that Whitaker is gone in two weeks when Barr comes in to be Attorney General for President Trump. The hearing was all a  sick show by Democrats for the cameras.Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker was on fire today during questioning from rude Democrats like Sheila Jackson-Lee and Jerrold Nadler.He also slammed Democrat Rep. Swalwell for his line of questions with a classic comment:“I am not here to be a puppet…”The first video is of Rep. Collins who is fantastic.

205,08-Feb-19,"Earlier this week, during his State Of The Union speech, President Trump made it perfectly clear to Americans that we will never be a Socialist nation.“Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt Socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence and not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free—and we will stay free.”Only two days later, Socialist freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has introduced a stunning Socialist “Green New Deal”.Her plan is a government-led overhaul of virtually every aspect of American life that would guarantee a host of taxpayer-covered benefits for all and phase out fossil fuels.Along the way, her office says the plan would aim to make air travel obsolete, upgrade or replace every building in America to ensure energy efficiency and give economic security even to those “unwilling” to work. –Fox NewsTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Senator “Spartacus” Corey Booker (D-NJ) is one of the 2020 Democrat presidential candidates to publicly sign on to Socialist dingbat, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal.Excited to join @AOC & @SenMarkey on a historic #GreenNewDeal resolution to address the peril of climate change and worsening inequality.

Because when our planet was imperiled in the past, who came forward to save earth from the scourge of Nazis and totalitarian regimes?”Our “planet was imperiled” and we saved “earth” from the Nazis? Hmmm…that’s a new twist on a horrific human tragedy. The irony here, of course, is that Booker is comparing how the United States destroyed the Socialist Nazi regime, as a way to push the largest Socialist scheme to date, on Americans.You can’t make this up.Cory “Spartacus” Booker says adopting the socialist “Green New Deal” would be like defeating the Nazis and putting a man on the moon.pic.twitter.com/QwqegeusJH— Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) February 8, 20192020 Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris has also jumped on the Socialist bandwagon with her endorsement of the Green New Deal.I’m proud to co-sponsor @AOC and @EdMarkey's Green New Deal.

209,07-Feb-19,"American’s are calling for the resignation of Democrat governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam after a photo was revealed on his personal page in his medical school yearbook, showing an image of two people standing side by side. One was wearing blackface and the other was wearing a KKK hood. Northam has denied that he is wearing either one of the racist costumes in the photo.Only one week later, the Democrat Attorney General in Virginia has now confessed that he too, wore blackface as part of a Halloween costume.Now, a 2016 clip from The View shows the unhinged anti-Trump Democrat activist, and The View co-host, Joy Behar, explaining while laughing with her fellow co-hosts, explaining why she also dressed as a Black woman for a Halloween party.During a discussion about an article in the New York Times praising “naturally curly hair,” The View flashed an image of Behar whose hair is curled to resemble an afro while wearing large hoop earrings and dark makeup.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The View showed the image of Behar’s dressing as a Black woman on the large screen behind the table where The View co-hosts are seated, including Black co-host Raven Symone. “It was a Halloween party, I went as a beautiful African woman,” Behar told her fellow co-hosts on a 2016 segment of The View. Co-host Raven Symone squealed when she saw the photo, asking Behar, “Are you black?” Behar responded by saying, “I was so cute.” Symone, (who is difficult to understand) appeared to ask Joy, “Are you mocking me, Joy?” Behar, unfazed by Symone, who was clearly offended,  attempted to clarify, “I was 29. It was a Halloween party. I went as a beautiful African woman.” Raven mumbled under her breath, “Oh, yes—you mean blackface?” Behar, who seemed to be annoyed with Symone’s comment about her, asked, “Why are you upset with me now? I had makeup on that was a little darker than my skin.” Raven Symone, who appeared to be mocking her replied under her breath, “Uh-huh…uh-huh,” while the other co-hosts nervously laughed.Watch:Joy Behar admitted during a taping of The View in 2016 to dressing as a “beautiful African women” at a Halloween party when she was 29 which involved makeup “that was a little bit darker than my skin”The show even ran an image of the old photo pic.twitter.com/qKQqzDPxyn— Jon Levine (@LevineJonathan) February 6, 2019Apparently, dressing up as a Black person for Halloween is all the rage for Democrats—the party that founded the KKK.Conservative Matt Walsh reminds us that Megyn Kelly was fired from her show for asking a hypothetical question about blackface.

210,07-Feb-19,"The family of Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann hired famed lawyer L. Lin Wood to take on the media and individuals who slandered the 16-year-old boy, after a manufactured incident in D.C. between Covington Catholic students, the hate group, the “Black Hebrew Israelites,” and the fake Vietnam vet and Native-American, Nathan Phillips.Wood is famous for winning defamation suits. He’s who you’d want if you were in the shoes of the Sandmann family. Nick Sandmann’s parents want their son’s name cleared and restored to good standing after the media and others blamed him for an incident that happened at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial.Prominent Democrat lawmakers like Muslim activist/U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), along with liberals on social media and a number of members of the media, twisted the truth about what happened that day in D.C., as the Covington Catholic boys waited for their bus to take them home to Kentucky from the March For Life. Eventually, several full-length videos were released, showing what really happened, and proving the Covington Catholic students were actually the victims.One of Sandmann’s most prominent critics following the manufactured event was Somali immigrant, and Muslim Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Omar tweeted about the young boy and attempted to tie him to President Trump (who she refers to as “individual-1,” a reference to another fake news story about Trump, that was published in Buzzfeed. It has since been debunked by special counsel Robert Mueller’s team). Omar tweeted: “This shameful behavior is a direct consequence of individual-1’s dehumanizing rhetoric and actions towards communities of color.

Their attitude is what elected Trump and what allows him and others to do and say the things they do. Thank you for standing up for decency and respect.Fortunately, some responsible Twitter users jumped on the thread of her hateful tweet and corrected her about what really happened.Do some research before jumping to conclusions. The BHI were harassing those kids and then Nathan Phillips walked up to them banging his drum in their face. That is the face of someone who is uncomfortable. There is an hour-long video that proves this.Now, almost three weeks later, after it’s been proven that the Covington Catholic boys were innocent kids targeted by a hate group and by an aging, leftist, Native-American agitator, John Calvi, a reporter for EWTN caught up with Omar to ask her about the Covington Catholic kids. Watch, as Omar refuses to apologize for the intentional trashing of their reputations on her Twitter account.WATCH: Rep.

212,06-Feb-19,"Television host Mike Rowe joined “Fox & Friends” Wednesday to weigh in on President Trump’s State of the Union address, saying the political polarization in the country is becoming “dangerous.”You may remember Mike Rowe from the show ‘Dirty Jobs’ but he’s doing so much more these days.He’s the founder of the Mike Rowe Works Foundation.He’s also been a supporter of President Trump’s effort to create jobs for all Americans.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]MIKE ROWE IS LOADED WITH COMMON SENSE!Here’s his latest thoughtful observation from his ‘Dirty Jobs’ days:THREE GREAT LIFE LESSONS LEARNED FROM GUN OWNERS:Mike Rowe of “Dirty Jobs,” recently spoke at a gun show where he told of three life lessons he learned from people who own guns. The people had all made an appearance on his show.Rowe began by claiming, “So much of what matters most to me came from people who own firearms.”THE FIRST LESSON – “BROWN BEFORE GREEN”A Nevada pig farmer who hunted to feed himself and used leftover Vegas casino buffet food to feed the pigs that he, in turn, used to feed the city, was that brown–not green– was the real color of conservation and planetary health, and the money needed to maintain it.“Brown before green,” Rowe said. It is the dirt, the muck, the ground-up brown slop, that produces the greenery that denotes planetary health.“Brown is best,” the pig farmer told Rowe. “Brown is fundamental. Green is symptomatic.”This pig farmer, despite the fact that he was cleaning up the excesses of the city to feed the city, came under attack from various government agencies–the “army of angry acronyms” Rowe called them–at the urging of neighbors who didn’t like living near a pig farm that was there decades before they were.Rowe’s message was that you don’t have to march with Al Gore or fly on fancy jets with Leonardo DiCaprio to be a conservationist. To be green, sometimes you have to be brown.THE SECOND LESSON – “IF YOU WANT TO GET HOME SAFE, THAT’S ON YOU.”His next lesson, gleaned from crab boat captains he met as a narrator for the show “Deadliest Catch,” was a riff on moral hazard, a term economists use to describe how insurance increases the likelihood of the risky behavior it’s attempting to mitigate.Rowe told the story of his one stint on a crab boat, in the middle of a raging, freezing storm capable of wiping out the boat and its entire crew. When he told the captain that maybe they should turn back, because safety comes first, the captain scoffed at him.“Safety first? I’m the captain of a crab boat,” the captain, also a gun owner told him. “My job is not to get you home safely. My job is to get you home rich.”“If you want to get home safe, that’s on you,” the captain said.His point? That when your safety becomes the priority of other people, it ceases to be your own responsibility, and the result is almost always less safety.“Personal responsibility is your best defense against a potential calamity,” Rowe noted to a room full of gun owners who regularly exercise their Second Amendment rights to carry firearms for personal defense, a lesson they all knew instinctively.THE THIRD LESSON – “BE WARY OF EXPERTS”His final lesson, learned from sheep farmers, was that sometimes experts don’t really know what they’re talking about. He learned this by watching sheep farmers castrate young lambs, but not in the way counseled by so-called animal humane experts.When Rowe watched them castrate the animals using the method recommended by so-called experts, it was barbaric, as it caused several days’ worth of horrific pain for the animals. The preferred method of the farmers on his show, although revolting in appearance, was over in an instant and saved the animals from the lengthy pain of the method demanded by the experts.“Be wary of experts,” he told the group. “Don’t dismiss them out of hand, but don’t always assume they know what they’re talking about.”“A pig farmer might know more than an MBA. A farmer might know more about being kind to animals than a self-appointed expert.”Mike Rowe certainly has a way with words and with common sense. He’s great at taming the left and gives great comebacks to their snarky questions about President Trump. He’s all about freedom and patriotism. He’s unafraid to support gun rights. There’s not much we don’t like about the guy. He a great American!Check out Mike Rowe’s non-profit mikeroweWORKS Foundation, which focuses on restoring appreciation for skilled trades and those who practice them. This cause is near an dear to Mike Rowe who has a fantastic Facebook page supporting blue collar workers and tradesman.",fake
213,06-Feb-19,"Was there a political motivation behind hiding the truth about the violent gang member who belongs to a gang that President Trump refers to its members as, “animals?”According to the New York Post, he’s an MS-13 gangster and illegal immigrant accused of murdering a rival on a subway platform— but you wouldn’t even recognize him on the street if the NYPD had its way.Cops bent over backward Tuesday to shield alleged killer Ramiro Gutierrez from public scrutiny after his arrest for Sunday’s broad-daylight slaying in Queens — going so far as to feed reporters bogus information about his whereabouts and claim ignorance on his illegal status hours before President Trump’s State of the Union Addressrenewing his request for a border wall.Gutierrez, 26, has been in custody since Monday for the execution-style killing of Abel Mosso, 20, in front of horrified straphangers.After the execution happened, local and national news organizations called the encounter a “fight” on the Queens subway station.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]But cops waited until 4 a.m. Tuesday to announce that he had been formally charged.Then they called reporters Tuesday afternoon to say that he would be walked out of the 115th Precinct station house at 4 p.m. — only to sneak him out a back door by 2 p.m. en route to a courthouse in Queens.It would have been the public’s first chance to get a good look at the accused killer — had The Post not already put him on the front page Tuesday thanks to law enforcement sources.Gutierrez shot Mosso “multiple times in the face” following a scuffle over a gun that spilled from a No. 7 train onto the 90th Street station platform in a “gang-related” incident, according to NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea.He had at least nine previous arrests that included four felonies.",fake

Legal and rare? Scratch “rare,” too. In New York City, one in three babies are aborted.In legalizing and then celebrating the brazen removal of protections for not just unborn children, wanted or unwanted, but women as well, New York dramatized something the left is increasingly struggling to hide: they are only interested in legal abortion, full stop. Safe and rare be darned.Last night, during his SOTU speech, President Trump brilliantly exposed the dark and evil truth about the Democrat Party. Democrat Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) was on his feet clapping for Trump’s announcement of the Paid Parental Leave act for women. While Democrats were on their feet, President Trump immediately segued into the Democrat Party’s New York abortion law and explained about the shameful support expressed by the disgraced Democrat Governor Ralph Northam, for killing babies after they’re born.Watch how quickly Schumer’s demeanor changes when President Trump brilliantly utters these words, literally seconds after Schumer was on his feet cheering:“There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies, who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world. And then, we had the case with the governor of Virginia who stated that he would execute a baby after birth.

Trump started out by looking at the Republican side of his audience, saying: “Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.” It was at that moment, that President Trump turned to address the smug, open borders Democrats, and that’s when the gloves came off. Trump looked directly at them and called them out for their hypocrisy, saying: “Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.” Republicans jumped to their feet and applauded Trump, showing their unity with him on the border issue. “Meanwhile,” Trump continued, “working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration, reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded, you can’t get in, increased crime and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate, it is actually very cruel.”Bingo…Trump just managed to brilliantly flip the “compassion” narrative on the Democrats, revealing how welcoming mass numbers of unvetted foreigners into our nation is anything but compassionate for American citizens.Watch:Standing directly in front of Nancy Pelosi, President Trump says, ""Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls, and gates and guards."" #SOTU pic.twitter.com/qUFToY2EbMTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]— Kyle Morris (@RealKyleMorris) February 6, 2019What do you think?

Some of the protesters held the door and wouldn’t allow it to close so Flake could proceed to his intended location, which was to be part of the vote for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s Supreme Court nominee who faces sexual assault accusations from Christine Blasey Ford.After some more in-depth investigation into the people who confronted Flake at the elevator, it was revealed that one of them works for an organization who takes money from George Soros. More on that in a moment.Let’s paint the picture of what happened earlier, so you have a deeper understanding of the scenario.As Flake stepped into the elevator, the protesters held the door open and wouldn’t allow him to leave. The protesters then confronted him, yelled at him, cried towards him, and put pressure on him to vote against Kavanaugh. The reporters were there too, asking questions and doing what they usually do. That’s when two women stepped up and demanded to take over the prime real estate in front of the elevator.One of the women is supposedly Ana Maria Archila. She and Maria Gallagher were there, and they are both sexual assault survivors, according to Heavy. Archila allegedly stood in Flake’s office and told him her story about being sexually assaulted, and it appears that she reminded him of that, stating “On Monday, I stood in your office. I told you of my story of my sexual assault.”Archila continued “I told it because I recognized in Dr. Ford’s story that she is telling the truth. What are you doing is allowing someone who violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court. This is not tolerable. You have children in your family. Think about them.” While Gallagher said, “I was sexually assaulted, and nobody believed me. I didn’t tell anyone, and you’re telling all women they don’t matter.” Gallagher then chastised Flake when she felt he was turning away saying, “Don’t look away from me. Look at me and tell me that it doesn’t matter what happened to me, that you will let people like that go into the highest court of the land and tell everyone what they can do to their bodies.”There’s a slight issue with what they said. Flake did not tell any woman that they do not matter. That is simply not true. That is a subjective opinion of the woman saying it and not a fact. That is someone trying to turn Jeff Flake into someone he is not.Why don’t we take a look at who one of the women are?Heavy’s website continued, stating “according to the website for Popular Democracy, Archila is the co-executive director of the liberal advocacy group, which is based in New York. The group describes itself as a “high-impact national organization that builds organizing power to transform the local and state policy landscape through deep, long-term partnerships with leading community-based organizing groups nationwide.” Archila joined the group in September 2013.”Ok, so why does that matter?Here is why.George Soros funds Popular Democracy.A document found on GiveWell.org listed a Soros organization, Open Society Foundations, as one of their largest donors. That document is here.A screenshot is provided here if the link gets removed.Is Archila part of a group that receives funding from George Soros?That answer is yes because she is listed with her name and photograph on the Center For Popular Democracy staff page.A screenshot is here, of course, if she has her information removed or the website changes their page because they are called out for receiving Soros money. Soros is mentioned on this page too.The website, Free Beacon, reported on May 10, 2017, some specifics about the amount of money exchanged. They stated “George Soros is one of the largest funders to the CPD. Soros provided the CPD with $130,000 from the Foundation to Promote Open Society in 2014 and $1,164,500 in 2015. Soros provided an additional $705,000 from the Open Society Policy Center in 2016.”There’s also a connection to a massive $80M anti-Trump network which is supported by Democrat Keith Ellison.Isn’t that odd?Ellison faces his accusations for allegedly abusing his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan.Is it just me, or do these folks dislike Donald Trump so much because he disrupted their plan to keep a Democrat in the big seat of the White House?This is one big sham.",fake

Earlier this week, it was reported by The Hill, that Democrats are looking for a primary challenger for Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, as they hope to make her a one-term Congresswoman.CNN reported on members of Davos laughing at Ocasio-Cortez last week.Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, suggested earlier this month that a 70% tax on income over $10 million could fund a climate change plan she’s pushing called the “Green New Deal.”But in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where thousands of the world’s top business, political and academic leaders meet each year, there was skepticism.During a panel, Michael Dell, the billionaire founder of Dell computers, was asked whether he supports Ocasio-Cortez’s plan. Before he could respond, many in the room burst out laughing, seemingly at the fact that Dell had to answer the question.Dell said he trusts his private foundation more than the US government to spend money wisely.“So no, I’m not supportive of [Ocasio-Cortez’s plan]. And I do not think it will help the growth of the US economy,” Dell said.Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire summed up Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet with one simple illustration. pic.twitter.com/cgp6xQ0w9M— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) February 4, 2019",fake

The cringe-worthy quote is in his description of how she helped him during his run for Mayor of San Francisco.He begins his commentary by pointing out her “missteps.” He mentions her “town meeting” in Iowa and how she “stepped in it” when she “lost her focus.” He says she “flippantly” dismissed the concerns of people who want to keep their private health care. His description comes off as criticism and is of no help to Harris. His final comment is the nail in the coffin. He writes that by Harris saying “let’s move that it sounded like she meant  “get over it”…Ouch!  With friends like this, who needs enemies? KAMALA’S “MISSTEPS”Sen. Kamala Harris’ Rolls-Royce rollout of her presidential run quickly shot her to the front of the Democratic pack and with it all the troubles that come with being seen as a front-runner.
The first misstep came during her televised town meeting in Iowa. She was terrific for the first three-quarters of the show, connecting with the audience both in the hall and those of us at home.
In the final quarter, however, her focus seemed to fade — and that’s when she stepped in it, flippantly dismissing the concerns of people who like their private health insurance and aren’t enthusiastic about replacing it with government-run Medicare for All. Her “let’s move on” line sounded a lot like, “Get over it.” It was a slip that instantly went national.Here’s where Brown gets into the extramarital relationship with Harris. Brown was married and having an affair with the much younger Harris during his run for mayor of San Francisco. When he won, Harris was on stage with him and gave him a hat that said “Da Mayor.” In previous comments (see our last report below), he said he helped Harris get to where she is now.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]He claims that he thought the affair was no big deal and would have been “just a chuckle” among “us locals.”Brown goes on to vaguely refer to the help he gave Harris by saying she helped him too. Next, we have the quote of the day that is just unbelievable. It’s in bold letters below.Brown concludes with the assertion that if she gets elected, he’ll “probably have to leave the country.”“SHE LOVED ME”And I must admit, I was no help to Harris on the national front.“Sure, I dated Kamala Harris. So what?” I thought that little item would put the issue to rest.Six months ago, it would have been just a chuckle among us locals. Harris’ emergence at the front of the presidential pack turned it into something that pundits from here to the Beltway parsed from every angle.Did I say that besides me helping her, she helped me? I honestly don’t think I would have made it through my first grueling run for mayor without her smarts and support.Now she’s happily married to a great guy. And if she gets elected, I’ll probably have to leave the country.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON HARRIS AND BROWN:“The elephant in the room” just made noise in a big way…
Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown had been silent about his extramarital affair with Kamala Harris up until now.He just broke his silence, and we think Kamala might not be too happy about that.The former San Francisco Mayor admitted in his weekly column that he used his powerful posts to help her career when they dated.Yes, Brown was openly having an affair with Harris when he was speaker of the California State Assembly and running for mayor. On the night Brown was elected mayor, Harris gave him a hat that said “Da Mayor.”HARRIS IS ON THE RIGHT IN THE PHOTO:Up until now, Harris and Brown have both avoided addressing Brown’s role in her early political career.In Brown’s latest column in the San Francisco Chronicle, he referred to the relationship with Harris as the “elephant in the room.” He also acknowledged that he used his influential position to help Harris’s political career and bank account:“Brown put Harris on part-time posts that supplemented her prosecutor’s salary with nearly $100,000 in extra annual pay.”“I’ve been peppered with calls from the national media about my ‘relationship’ with Kamala Harris, most of which I have not returned.”“Yes, we dated.” ",fake

231,03-Feb-19,"Democrat leaders are defiantly standing against President Trump’s request for $5.7 billion to build a wall on our southern border. It’s no secret their resistance to funding President’s wall is all about stopping Trump from following through on his most popular campaign promise to the American people, that he would build a wall on our southern border. Every day, there are new stories about illegal aliens who are committing crimes against law-abiding American citizens, yet incredibly, the media continues to make President Trump the villain for wanting to secure our borders and keep the rampant crime in Mexico on their side of the border.This horrific story of an American anarchist, who was murdered in a resort town in Acapulco, Mexico is a stark reminder of how much worse the crime rate in Mexico is, compared to the that of cities in America with the highest crime rates.The Daily Mail reports – An American woman posted a chilling video on social media in which she describes the murder of her anarchist boyfriend by assailants in the Mexican resort town of Acapulco.The woman who says she is the victim’s partner, Lily, said via social media that she saw the gunmen go straight for her boyfriend, who she calls John Galton, and his friend Jason Henza, 43.‘Lily’ was later confirmed to be a woman who goes by the name Lily Forester. Both Lily and John are anarchists who, in early 2016, fled drug charges in the U.S.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Henza made it to a private hospital with bullet wounds in an armpit, leg, and hand. The hospital said he checked out that same day.The dreadlocked couple, both in their 20s, posted a video to Facebook two months ago calling for attendees at the conference.In his post, a bearded Henza said in a blood-splattered shirt: ‘We were attacked. I’ve been shot three times. I’m not doing so good.’***WARNING*** While the video below does not show any violence, it does show Henza speaking to the camera after he was shot and his girlfriend pleading for help. Some of the images may be disturbing to some viewers.Because I am in Asia, some can't see the live share I did on my wall so here it is. Lily Forester is pleading for help. Her husband was shot dead and Jason Henza was shot three times. These are members of the Anarchapulco community in Acapulco, Mexico.Posted by Barry Cooper on Friday, February 1, 2019When asked about the high crime rates in Acapulco, the blue-eyed anarchist with scruffy facial hair said: ‘I’d say it’s safer than any big city I’ve lived in in the U.S., like way safer than Chicago or something like that.’Guerrero state, home to Acapulco, has a murder rate of 64.2 per 100,000 residents, more than two times that of Chicago.Acapulco has become a hotbed for violence between drug gangs.Criminals are crossing our southern border on a regular basis. Sadly, Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are willing to subject the American people to unvetted foreigners illegally crossing our borders, as long as it means keeping President Trump out of the White House in 2020. ",fake

They also revealed that they will do anything to stand in the way of Trump taking credit for building a border wall, all but ensuring he’ll be re-elected in 2020.On Jan 23, the loudmouth Democrat Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (TX) stepped down as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and as chair of a congressional subcommittee amid allegations, she retaliated against a former staffer who claimed she was raped by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation supervisor, Damien Jones.Only one day after Virginia’s Democrat Governor Ralph Northam publicly announced that he would be okay with babies being killed after they were born, it was discovered that the Democrat governor from Virginia also thinks it’s okay to dress in blackface or wear a KKK hood, Northam’s personal page in his medical school yearbook revealed shocking photos.Now, it’s been discovered that Chuck Schumer’s top aide, Matt House is on his way out for having inappropriate relations with junior staffers, the same behavior that got Democrat President Bill Clinton impeached, after he lied to a grand jury about having sex with a young intern in the Oval Office.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]According to the Huffington Post -Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s longtime communications director Matt House announced he was leaving just after November’s midterm elections, the news was met with widespread bipartisan praise for House and his reputation for fairness. But some of House’s Senate colleagues were surprised to learn of his departure, given that he did not have a high-profile job lined up and that Democrats could regain control of the Senate in 2020.House’s departure, however, was not voluntary. HuffPost has learned, through two sources with knowledge of the situation, that House was pushed out for allegedly having inappropriate sexual encounters with junior staffers, ending what was a nearly six-year tenure as communications director for the New York Democrat. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to a reporter about the allegations.In a text-message statement late Friday, a spokesman for Schumer confirmed that House was forced out after the encounters were alleged:Upon learning that he had inappropriate encounters within the office and that it was making some staff uncomfortable, he was asked to leave.I absolutely loved my time working in the Senate and it was the honor of my life. I deeply regret the mistakes I made on the number of occasions when I had too much to drink, and I apologize to anyone who was affected by my behavior. I have always respected all of my colleagues and I was horrified to learn that I made anyone feel uncomfortable.

The person with the black face is also wearing a white hat, black jacket, white shirt with a bow tie and plaid pants. Both are holding canned drinks.After several hours, Governor Northam finally admitted that he is one of the people in the photo with the KKK hood and black face.Earlier today, we reported that both Democrat Senators from Virginia, Mark Warner, and Tim Kaine, have refused to call for the resignation of Governor Ralph Northam.Instead, of asking Northam to step down or to be strung up in the town square, as they would likely demand if Northam were a Republican, they simply asked Northam to “listen” to those he has hurt:Donald Trump Jr. published a tweet from Kamala Harris, congratulating her fellow Democrat on becoming the new governor of Virginia. What’s striking about her tweet, is that Harris didn’t just congratulate him, she took it one step further, by stating the reason Northam was elected as Virginia’s next governor was because of how Northam and his team showed that “Virginia won’t stand for hatred and bigotry.” Harris probably forgot about how the KKK has deep ties to the Democrat Party and was in fact, created by Democrats in the South.Along with the stunning image, the youngest son of President Trump, who is known for his great sense of humor tweeted:Well this is awkward & didn’t age well at all.Well this is awkward & didn’t age well at all. pic.twitter.com/H9v7qK5ZWm— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) February 2, 2019Twitter users quickly posted images of President Trump being honored for his work in the black community, like the one below posted by conservative activist Jack Posobiec.

240,31-Jan-19,"“I see this as a grave national security concern and vulnerability.” – ICE Special Agent in Los AngelesBirth tourism is nothing new but because our national security is so lax, the scam industry has grown like wildfire.California happens to be where many of the birth tourism “hotels” are located. A pregnant woman from China, Russia, and other foreign countries hides her pregnancy to come to America. She stays at a “birth hotel” until she gives birth. The whole point of this is to give the newborn American citizenship.Yes, our government has incentivized women to come to our country and give birth because the child gets automatic American citizenship. Also, when the child turns 21, they can move to the U.S. and then their parents can apply for a green card.Let’s hope that with the new indictments against the people running the birth tourism businesses, this will help put an end to it.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Of the three businesses involved, one of them advertised that they’ve brought 8,000 women to the U.S. to give birth.Wealthy Chinese couples pay the company big money to travel to the U.S. to deliver their babies.Twenty people have been charged in the biggest crackdown ever on helping Chinese women come to the U.S. to give birth.
Washington Times reports:Three people were arrested in Southern California on charges including conspiracy, visa fraud and money laundering. More than a dozen others have also been charged in cases stemming from three so-called birth tourism businesses, with many believed to be in China, the U.S. Attorney’s office said.It is the first time the United States has criminally prosecuted birth tourism operators, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office.U.S. authorities said the businesses not only engaged in fraud but have created a national security risk. Their customers — some who work for the Chinese government — have secured American citizenship for children who can later move back to the United States, and once they’re 21 years old, sponsor their parents for green cards.The pregnant women can also be in danger.CHINESE AND RUSSIAN BIRTH TOURISM:NBC reports:Southern California apartment complexes that doubled as “maternity hotels” for Chinese women who want made-in-America babies were raided, capping an unprecedented federal sting operation, officials said.NBC News was on the scene as Homeland Security agents swept into The Carlyle, a luxury property in Irvine, California, which housed pregnant women and new moms who allegedly forked over $40,000 to $80,000 to give birth in the United States.“I am doing this for the education of the next generation,” one of the women told NBC News.None of the women were arrested; they are being treated as material witnesses, and paramedics were on hand in case any of them went into labor during the sweep.Instead, the investigation was aimed at ringleaders who pocketed hundreds of thousands of dollars tax-free to help Chinese nationals obtain visas and then pamper them until they delivered in an American hospital at a discount, court papers show.“It’s not necessarily illegal to come here to have the baby, but if you lie about your reasons for coming here, that’s visa fraud,” said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations for Los Angeles.All told, the feds raided 20 locations in Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties, targeting three competing birth tourism schemes, officials said. The suspected operators have not been charged but are being questioned.The organizers who allegedly ran the Carlyle site, Chao Chen and Dong Li, used a website to drum up business, touting the benefits of a child with U.S. citizenship: 13 years of free education, low-cost college financial aid, less pollution, and a path for the entire family to emigrate when the child becomes an adult.Clients were counseled on what lies to tell to obtain a tourist visa; how to fly through Hawaii, Las Vegas or Korea to avoid suspicious immigration officers at Los Angeles International Airport; and how to disguise their pregnancy in transit, according to search warrant affidavit unsealed Tuesday.The women were then set up at the Carlyle, which charges about $3,000 a month for a two-bedroom apartment and features amenities including private balconies, a resort-style pool, and cabanas with flat-screen televisions.A neighbor, Linda Trust, told NBC News she did find it strange that she had seen a forklift deliver a huge pile of diapers to the buildings but had never seen a baby.The women’s handlers provided transportation for doctor visits and trips to restaurants and shops, the court papers say. An agent tailing one of the suspects followed them to Target and Babies R Us.They were funneled to several Orange County hospitals to deliver, but they didn’t pay full price — approximately $25,000 — for medical services, officials said. Instead, they got reduced rates for the indigent, ranging from nothing to $4,000, the court papers say.That translated into big losses for the hospitals. More than 400 babies linked to the scheme were born at just one facility in a two-year period, investigators said.The investigators discovered that the parents of one baby born in April 2014 who paid the hospital just $4,000 were spending money at the Wynn Las Vegas Hotel, Rolex and Louis Vuitton, using an account with almost a quarter of a million dollars in it.The fraud, authorities say, went beyond the visas.Li didn’t file a U.S. tax return and Chen didn’t declare hundreds of thousands of dollars in proceeds, the affidavit says. In addition, Chen and his wife, Jie Zhu committed marriage fraud, pretending to be divorced so they could get “green-card” marriages in the U.S., the feds charged.Efforts to reach Chen, Zhu and Li by phone were unsuccessful. It was not clear if they have retained legal counsel.The phenomenon of foreigners coming to the U.S. to have babies is not new but appears to be growing. One study found that 40,000 children a year are born to women here on a travel visa, the affidavit notes.RUSSIAN ‘BIRTH HOTELS’…A growing number of Russians are coming to the U.S. to give birth. These kids will have the right to live and work here, receive social services and, when they turn 21, will have the right to sponsor their parents for an American Green Card.

241,31-Jan-19,"Amid record-breaking cold temperatures, the CEO and President of Consumers Power, Patti Poppe, one of Michigan’s primary providers of energy, has taken to Facebook to ask Michigan citizens to turn down their thermostats for two days. General Motors and Ford have suspended production at several automotive plants to help Consumers Power deal with the potential crisis.The head of Consumers, on the coldest day of the year, asked  its 1.8 million customers Wednesday night to use less gas to heat their homes following the fire at one of the utility’s “most significant facilities,” which accounts a majority of its supply.That was quickly followed by a request from the governor urging dialing thermostats down to 65 and Michigan Public Service Commission asking customers to reduce usage. Soon after, an emergency alert asked gas customers to cut usage. –Detroit NewsAfter an explosion and fire at one of the top gas compression stations in MI, Consumers Power CEO, Patti Poppe, who hopes to completely eliminate the use of coal to produce electricity by 2040, as a way to stop global warming, was forced to explain to the “unprecedented crisis” they are facing as a result of record cold temperatures.Last year, the AP reported – Consumers Energy and DTE Energy Co., which supply most of Michigan’s electricity, are among many U.S. providers moving away from coal even as President Donald Trump’s administration boosts fossil fuels and seeks to unravel former President Barack Obama’s policies that promoted cleaner power.Now, Consumers Energy President and CEO Patti Poppe is taking to Facebook to plead with customers to dial back their heat for the two coldest days in recent history. Poppie warned customers there would be brief, localized shutoffs if customers ignored the request. Poppe told MI customers, “This truly is an unprecedented crisis.

Residents reported hearing an explosion, followed by flames that burned into the air and were visible for miles.Consumers Energy officials said automatic equipment known as a fire gate shut off the flow of gas to the fire, which limited damage to the site and vent out the gas. The utility’s onsite incident management team determined the fire was contained and allowed a controlled burn to exhaust natural gas product remaining in the pipes. –Macomb DailyMichigan’s new Democrat governor, and global warming alarmist, Gretchen Whitmer also posted a video to Twitter, asking lower Michigan residents to cut back on their use of gas during the record-breaking cold temperatures.Due to extremely high demand for natural gas with record-low temperatures, and an incident at a facility, @ConsumersEnergy has asked everyone who is able to please turn down their thermostats to 65° or less until Friday at noon. #MIREADY pic.twitter.com/FWKCZnu9QA— Governor Gretchen Whitmer (@GovWhitmer) January 31, 2019While running for governor in Michigan, Whitmer told Bridge MI: “I believe that climate change is real and we need to take steps to combat it,” Whitmer said in an email through spokeswoman Eileen Belden. “The facts show that this is a real threat to our environment, our economy, and the health and wellbeing of the people of our state.”Whitmer pledged to enter Michigan into the U.S. Climate Alliance, a group of 17 governors committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, the international treaty President Donald Trump vows to leave. She also promised to create a state “department of the Great Lakes and Fresh Water”, which would house an “Office of Climate Change.”Three days ago, President Trump tweeted about the Polar Vortex, warning citizens of record cold temperatures.

244,30-Jan-19,"During his interview with Fox News’ Judge Napolitano, Roger Stone relayed the horrifying moment when Stone realized his wife might get shot by Meuller’s SWAT Team. Stone told the judge that his wife is “hearing impaired”  for not complying with orders she couldn’t hear.Stone’s wife, Nydia Betran, who was born on May 8, 1946, in Cuba, is no stranger to Gestapo style tactics used against citizens. Betran relocated to the United States in 1959 with her family and began working as a model appearing in local advertisements.Betran was also interested in photography and became a news photographer covering a number of events such as presidential campaigns. While working on President Ronald Reagan’s campaign, she met Stone. They two began dating and tied the knot in Las Vegas in 1992.Stone told Judge Napolitano that at six 0’clock in the morning there was “pounding on the door” and that he was “sleeping on the second floor with my wife, who is hearing impaired—virtually deaf.” After Stone relayed the stunning number of FBI agents with “sidearms and assault weapons pointed at my home.” Stone told Napolitano that he was told by the FBI agents  to “come out with my hands up.” Stone continued, “I was told I told to come out with my hands up— I did. I was told I was uh, under arrest. No one read me my rights, I might add.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Stone relayed one of the more frightening moments of the pre-dawn raid for him and his wife: “I was afraid that  they would go upstairs, think my wife was not complying with to an order that she could not hear, and shoot her.” Napolitano asked, “Did they take your wife out of the house, Roger?” Stone told the judge that they did bring his “barefoot” wife outside and made her stand next to him, even though she wasn’t guilty of anything.Watch the incredible exchange here:It isn’t the first time Mueller’s squad of goons treated the wife of a suspect tied to President Trump with utter disrespect.According to the Washington Times, the July 2017, pre-dawn raid of the Manafort home also involved the “manhandling” of Mrs. Manafort.It has been reported that the agents checked Mr. Manafort and wife Kathleen for guns as they broke into the Alexandria condo pre-dawn by picking the lock.A source familiar with the case told The Washington Times the search was even more intrusive: An agent patted down Mrs. Manafort before she was allowed to get out of bed.“Agents felt up Mrs. Manafort lying in bed to see if she had guns,” the source said of the intimidation.In all, 12 FBI agents entered the home, with guns drawn, and stayed for hours.The aggressive search of a prone sleepy woman is, the source said, a hallmark of Mr. Mueller’s top prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann.

248,28-Jan-19,"It’s hard to imagine that “Mr. Reagan” could produce a Gillette parody ad that was as funny or even funnier than his first one (approaching one million views), but we’re here to tell you—he’s done it again!  And this hilarious Gillette parody video includes the Covington Catholic boys, the fake Vietnam veteran, Nathan Phillips and the racist, hate preachers, the Black Hebrew Israelites.The video starts out with a close up of Nick Sandmann, the 16-year-old boy who was confronted by the fake Vietnam veteran and Native American Nathan Phillips. Phillips approached Nick while he was standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with his classmates from Covington Catholic School, as they waited for their bus to arrive and take them home from the March for Life in D.C. For some unknown reason, Phillips chose Sandmann as his target, zoomed in on him, and began chanting loudly, while banging his drum inches from the 16-year-old’s face. After spending the last hour or more listening to the hate-filled, Black Hebrew Israelites call the Covington Catholic kids “incest babies” and “racists” for wearing “Make America Great Again” hats, it’s pretty clear to see why the teen was uncomfortable with Phillips’ aggressive posturing that was directed at him. Sandmann, later admitted that he smiled at Phillips, hoping he would be able to de-escalate another potentially volatile situation.In his “Gillette ad,” “Mr. Reagan” does a brilliant job of revealing the way the left tried to twist the bullying of Sandmann while putting a humorous spin on a horrible situation.The ad begins by zooming in a photo of the smiling 16-year-old Sandmann, as the narrator asks: “Is this the best a man can get—a straight, white Trump supporter?” Enjoy (language warning):Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]In his first Gillette parody ad, that has almost one million views, “Mr. Reagan” points out the repeated use of Black men interceding to stop stupid white men from harassing women. The video starts out by saying, “Hey look, everybody, our first shot is of a stoic black man” they flash to a White guy saying, ” This guy’s ashamed of himself for being White and a man” as they flash to the next guy, saying, “Look at this guy—he’s about the cry. He’s not only White and a man, but he’s also old—disgusting!” The next shot is of a young White boy with red hair, the narrator asks, “Is this the best a man can get—a soulless ginger?”  The narrator then points out one of  the primary motives behind the Gillette ad, saying, “We know that most of you men are unaware of this, so we are here to educate you…” telling their target market that “bullying is mean and bad.” Because, clearly without Gillette, boys and men would think that bullying is good—right?The final line of the parody ad says it all, “Gillette, we virtue signal better than anybody”After the final line, the narrator hilariously mocks Gillette, signing: “Gillette, ridding the world of toxic masculinity. Everybody should vote Democrat.  Gillette, we’re so awesome, everybody should buy our razors. Don’t go to Dollar Shave Club, Dollar Shave Club is toxic masculinity.”Here’s “Mr. Reagan’s” original Gillette parody ad:",fake

251,26-Jan-19,"Last weekend, we watched liberals descend on a 16-yr-old boy Covington Catholic schoolboy like a pack of hyenas, for daring to appear in public wearing a hat showing his support for our elected President of the United States.It’s no surprise then, after watching example after example of liberals attempting to ruin their fellow American’s lives for publicly supporting our president, that a 23-yr-old model living in NYC would be afraid of the consequences for revealing her support for President Trump.The New York Post reports, Elizabeth Pipko, a 23-year-old model who has appeared in Maxim, has kept a secret from her industry colleagues out of fear it could derail her career: She was a Donald Trump supporter and worked full-time on his 2016 presidential campaign.I decided to volunteer for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in the spring of 2016. I never leaned liberal or conservative, but there was something about Trump — the way he spoke and his honesty — that had me convinced he was our next president. I worked in a call center in Trump Tower. Within eight weeks, I was hired as a national volunteer services coordinator for the data team and paid $4,000 a month.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]It was clear from the start that, if I wanted to survive in modeling, I couldn’t tell anyone about my new job.Once, after working a 10-hour-day on the Trump campaign, I went to meet with my manager (who was not affiliated with a modeling agency). He and a colleague were enraged, screaming about how much they hate Trump. My manager kept saying how evil the people who work for him must be and that he would never work with anyone who supported him.I was terrified they would find out that I was one of the so-called evil people.So I lied and told people I was coaching ice skating — I was a competitive figure skater for seven years — whenever I was really hard at work in Trump Tower. When I ran into a modeling friend on my way there one day, I immediately hid my badge and said I was running errands.But at every modeling job or meeting, the talk inevitably turned to Trump, and it was always high-stress.At one shoot, the photographer came in wearing a black T-shirt with a gigantic red slash over Trump’s face. I was so unnerved, I could barely concentrate on the job at hand.But now that it’s been two years since the election, I don’t want to keep silent any longer. Even if that means saying goodbye to modeling forever.Pipka met her husband, Darren Centinello (see photo below), who works on trump’s digital and social media campaign for the 2020 race. The two were recently married at Mar-a-Lago.I think Trump is great for women. He’s always promoted women to leadership positions at his real estate company and at the White House. And as for the alleged payoffs to various women — it’s none of my business. I care about what President Trump has done and will do for my country.I’m already hoping to take part in the reelection in some capacity. And this time, I’m not going to hide it.model",fake
252,26-Jan-19,"One of the many reasons to have a secure border is to keep diseases and illnesses out of America.For every sick person detained by border patrol, how many others make it through to communities all across America to spread different illnesses?How about those who present themselves at the border with a severe illness that requires more extensive treatment?  The cost and the risk to all Americans cannot be denied.Who pays for the medical treatment of these people at the border or at our emergency rooms across the country? Shouldn’t we be asking for details on how much it costs to treat these people?The cost has been reported at many different levels depending on who is doing the reporting. Forbes reported that the cost is $18.5 billion for all medical help for illegals:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]All told, Americans cross-subsidize health care for unauthorized immigrants to the tune of $18.5 billion a year .

Border Patrol station told an agent Thursday about a growing rash he had.He was taken to a medical facility for evaluation. Officials said hospital staff diagnosed him with a flesh-eating bacteria. They said he needed more extensive treatment.On the same day, a large group of 306 crossed illegally at the southern New Mexico border.Some of the people in the group were in need of immediate medical help and were taken to local hospitals for different illnesses. Not until this illegal was exposing others to his “rash” did the border patrol realize he had flesh-eating bacteria. Local hospitals are treating these people for so many different ailments but what if someone is brought in with a very contagious and deadly illness? Doesn’t that illegal put all around him at risk?The cost must be enormous to treat these people who obviously have no way of paying. This falls on the backs of the American taxpayer.

The program is called Migrant Protection Protocols and is a new way to discourage Central Americans from trying to make the journey to the U.S.  A record number of asylum seekers came to the U.S. last year so President Trump is trying to do anything he can to diminish the flow.The first group of asylum seekers will be returned to the border town of Tijuana tomorrow, according to a Mexican government spokesperson.The new policy change took place on December 20th and sends the non-Mexican asylum seekers back across the border to wait in Mexico for their court case on asylum.

263,23-Jan-19,"Jackson Lee is resigning as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and as chair of a congressional subcommittee amid allegations she retaliated against a former staffer who claimed she was raped by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation supervisor, Damien Jones.According to the Daily Caller – Both BuzzFeed and The New York Times report Jackson Lee will leave as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, a non-profit group closely aligned with the Congressional Black Caucus.She will also leave her position temporarily as chair of a House Judiciary subcommittee.The Democrat came under pressure last week to resign her posts after she was accused in a Jan. 11 lawsuit of retaliating against a former staffer who claimed she was sexually assaulted by Damien Jones, a former intern supervisor at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation.According to the Washington Free Beacon – Damien Jones, who recently served as Beto O’Rourke’s regional political director during his unsuccessful senate bid, is named in a new lawsuit suit against Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Texas) and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation for their handling of a rape allegation against him.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]A former CBCF intern alleges in the lawsuit that she was raped by Jones, who at the time was 30 years old and the CBCF’s intern coordinator, in October 2015 when she was 19 years old, according to BuzzFeed. The intern alleging Jones raped her is identified in court papers by the pseudonym Jane Doe.According to the complaint, on Oct. 24, 2015, Jones invited Jane Doe to dinner, where she says he ordered a large quantity of drinks. She alleged that he then took her back to his home, poured more drinks, and that her memory became foggy about the rest of the night. She said she sent a series of text messages to a friend that night including, “Help,” “I’m want t[sic] to go home,” and “I’m ready to cry,” and told the friend she was with the intern coordinator but did not know where she was.The woman said she remembered Jones engaging in sexual activity with her, including forcing her to perform oral sex. In the complaint she said she did not consent to any sexual activity. The next morning, she said she woke up naked in Jones’ bed “with his arms and legs around her,” and left. She said she experienced pain in her vagina and elsewhere on her body.Jane Doe said later that day she texted Jones to ask what happened, and he replied, “Nothing. You threw up everywhere. That’s it.” When she asked why she was naked, he told her to call him. Jane Doe says that he told her that he took off her clothes and put her in the shower, and he denied they had sex.The woman began working in November 2017 as a staffer for Jackson Lee. According to her lawsuit, she asked Jackson Lee’s chief of staff in March 2018 to meet with the lawmaker to discuss her alleged rape. The meeting never occurred, and the woman was fired soon after from Jackson Lee’s office.According to Black conservative Wayne Dupree, Jackson Lee is listed as meanest Congress member to employees and those that served her for almost a decade now. She has an image to protect, and it’s not easy to continuously hold the heavyweight title with the likes of Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi climbing up the ranks.A very informed friend of mine claimed she was banned from Continental Airlines because she always arrives late and expects the planes to be held for her. She took a framed proclamation (poster size) to Michael Jackson’s funeral and spoke, of course. She was late to the Wreaths Across America event on year in Houston, and they refused to let her speak.",fake

The former Obama regime Secretary of State has repeatedly bashed Trump since he was elected president. It makes you wonder what Kerry is afraid of and who he’s protecting.He claimed today that President trump doesn’t “take any of this seriously”. Kerry was referring to climate change and said “people will die because of the president’s decision.”Kerry came off as an elitist who knows better than President Trump.He came off as a seditious jackwagon looking down his nose at everyone.

He reportedly told them they would just have to “wait this administration out”:Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had strong words for John Kerry during a press conference at the state department:“What Secretary Kerry did was unseemly and unprecedented. This is a former secretary of state engaged with the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, and according to him…you don’t have to take my word for it, these are his answers…he was talking to them. He was telling them to wait out this administration.”“You can’t find precedent for this in U.S. history, and Secretary Kerry ought not to engage in that kind of behavior. It’s inconsistent with what the foreign policy of the United States is as directed by this president, and it is beyond inappropriate for him to be engaged in this.”Kerry has admitted to four meetings with the Iranians…Who does this guy think he is? He arrogantly admitted that he lied about getting 100% of the chemical weapons out of Syria (video below) and now this:He’s not a part of the Trump administration’s State Department so why is John Kerry  undermining the foreign policy of President Trump?Obama’s SOS John Kerry just admitted he’s been going rogue by meeting with Iranian officials to try and save the Iran nuke deal:WFB reports:Kerry, in an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt to promote his new book, said that he has met with Iranian Former Minister Javad Zarif—the former secretary’s onetime negotiating partner—three or four times in recent months behind the Trump administration’s back.“I think I’ve seen him three or four times” – John Kerry said, adding that he has been conducting sensitive diplomacy without the current administration’s authorization. Kerry said he has criticized the current administration in these discussions, chiding it for not pursuing negotiations from Iran, despite the country’s fevered rhetoric about the U.S. president.“Conducting sensitive diplomacy”?

If you didn’t see it, the video is below.Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is supposed to be back on the court February 19th but Fox News had everyone wondering what’s going on when they flashed an obituary photo during a segment this morning. The hosts came back with an immediate apology. Oops!Ginsburg has been recovering from cancer surgery on her lung. She had cancerous nodules removed and has been recovering at home. All reports from the media are saying she’s “on track” with her recovery but rumblings of illness have been reported too.Ginsburg said she would retire when she could no longer do her job. Sounds like it’s time for her to retire since she cannot do her job at the Supreme Court but has to work remotely from home.The bigger question is does Fox News know something we don’t?Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Check out the gaffe from this morning:Fox News just slipped in Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s obituary segment opener pic.twitter.com/PfN6ICltYb— Chip Douglas (@AreaMan_) January 21, 2019OUR REPORT ON GINSBURG MISSING ORAL ARGUMENTS AND A REPORT ON HER JUDICIAL ACTIVISM:Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will miss next week’s Supreme Court Oral Arguments as announced in a Supreme Court statement just released:“Justice Ginsburg will continue to work from home next week and will participate in the consideration and decision of the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts of oral arguments. Her recovery from surgery is on track.”She’ll “work from home”? Is this fair to the Americans involved in the cases being considered?Ginsburg has been recovering from lung cancer surgery and is said to be ‘on track’ for recovery but has been suspiciously absent from all activities that have to do with the Supreme Court.She has missed every day since the new session started so the question should be asked:Ginsburg said she would retire when she’s not able to fulfill her duties. Wouldn’t that time be now?We have a Supreme Court Justice who cannot do her job, RIGHT? Not to mention, she’s as openly biased as they come…OUR REPORT ON GINSBURG’S EXTREME COMMENTS AND ANTI-TRUMP COMMENTS ARE BAD ENOUGH:Don’t you love how the left is screaming about the so-called “extreme” picks by Trump for SCOTUS? Well, we’ve got extreme for you and it isn’t anyone on the right. The lefty Supreme Court women have voiced their disregard for the bedrock of our nation…the constitution. They’ve also claimed that the electoral college is bunk and that illegal aliens are to be considered just like us. Yep, these are the women of the highest court in the land…scary, huh?We have been covering these activist judges for some time and cannot believe that the Republicans have let this golden moment slip. They could be pulling the video clips below and using them to slam the very extreme views of these Supreme Court Justices! This is why it’s so important to bring the court back to being apolitical…Andrew McCarthy of The National Review said it best:It is simply accepted that these justices are not there to judge. They are there to vote. They get to the desired outcome the same way disparate-impact voodoo always manages to get to discrimination: Start at the end and work backward. Guiding precedents are for the quaint business of administering justice. In the social justice business, the road never before traveled will do if one less traveled is unavailable.But there’s a problem. Once it has become a given that a critical mass of the Supreme Court is no longer expected, much less obliged, to do law, then the Court is no longer a legal institution.

“Well, some things I would like to change, one is the electoral college,” she said, to rapturous applause. “But that would require a constitutional amendment. Amending our constitution is powerfully hard to do, as I know from the struggle for the Equal Rights Amendment, which fell three state shy [of passage].
So much for the SCOTUS being apolitical…Check out her comments on equality for women. It’s like she’s time traveled back to the 50’s. What is the deal with these women that think we’re still in the dark ages!Speaking to BBC Newsnight in a rare interview, Justice Ginsburg reiterated the importance of the free press.“I read the Washington Post and the New York Times every day, and I think that the reporters are trying to tell the public the way things are,” she said.Justice Ginsburg was nominated by Bill Clinton and is regarded as a liberal.Justice Ginsburg was careful to avoid commenting directly on Donald Trump’s presidency.Before the election, in July 2016, Justice Ginsburg criticised Donald Trump – calling him “a faker”. She later said she regretted making the comments.Watch:“Think of what the press has done in the United States,” she said citing the Watergate scandal. “That story might never have come out if we didn’t have the free press that we do.”Asked about the rise of the so-called “post truth world”, Justice Ginsburg said: “I am optimistic in the long run. A great man once said that the true symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle. It is the pendulum.“And when the pendulum swings too far in one direction it will go back.“Some terrible things have happened in the United States but one can only hope that we learn from those bad things.”Justice Ginsburg said she was encouraged by the Women’s March, which saw millions in the US and around the world take part in anti-Trump protests.“I’ve never seen such a demonstration – both the numbers and the rapport of the people in that crowd. There was no violence, it was orderly. So yes, we are not experiencing the best times but there is there is reason to hope that that we will see a better day.”Justice Ginsburg has been on the Supreme Court since 1993 and – at 83 years-old – is the oldest serving member.Asked how much longer she would stay in post, she said: “At my age you have to take it year by year. I know I’m OK. What will be next year?”She added: “I’m hopeful however, because my most senior colleague the one who most recently retired, Justice John Paul Stevens, stepped down at age 90. So I have a way to go.” – BBCNew York Times 2005: “Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court embraced the practice of consulting foreign legal decisions…rejecting the argument from conservatives that United States law should not take international thinking into account.”“I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life” – Supreme Court Justice SotomayorAs the main stream media does a hit job on Donald Trump for expressing his view that the presiding judge in the Trump University case is biased against him because of Trump’s views on immigration, we have a RACIST Latina Supreme Court Justice who’s openly declaring that the ethnicity and sex of a judge makes a difference in their judging! So which is it?  The left wants to have it both ways but they’re being outed as total hypocrites! Unreal!  Judge Sotomayor questioned whether achieving impartiality “is possible in all, or even, in most, cases.” She added, “And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society.”AND THEY’RE CALLING TRUMP A RACIST?WASHINGTON — In 2001, Sonia Sotomayor, an appeals court judge, gave a speech declaring that the ethnicity and sex of a judge “may and will make a difference in our judging.”In her speech, Judge Sotomayor questioned the famous notion — often invoked by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her retired Supreme Court colleague, Sandra Day O’Connor — that a wise old man and a wise old woman would reach the same conclusion when deciding cases.“I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life,” said Judge Sotomayor, who is now considered to be near the top of President Obama’s list of potential Supreme Court nominees.Her remarks, at the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Law and Cultural Diversity Lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, were not the only instance in which she has publicly described her view of judging in terms that could provoke sharp questioning in a confirmation hearing.This month, for example, a video surfaced of Judge Sotomayor asserting in 2005 that a “court of appeals is where policy is made.” She then immediately adds: “And I know — I know this is on tape, and I should never say that because we don’t make law. I know. O.K. I know. I’m not promoting it. I’m not advocating it. I’m — you know.”The video was of a panel discussion for law students interested in becoming clerks, and she was explaining the different experiences gained when working at district courts and appeals courts. Her remarks caught the eye of conservative bloggers who accused her of being a “judicial activist,” although Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University law school, argued that critics were reading far too much into those remarks.Republicans have signaled that they intend to put the eventual nominee under a microscope, and they say they were put on guard by Mr. Obama’s statement that judges should have “empathy,” a word they suggest could be code for injecting liberal ideology into the law.Judge Sotomayor has given several speeches about the importance of diversity. But her 2001 remarks at Berkeley, which were published by the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal, went further, asserting that judges’ identities will affect legal outcomes.“Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences,” she said, for jurists who are women and nonwhite, “our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.”Her remarks came in the context of reflecting her own life experiences as a Hispanic female judge and on how the increasing diversity on the federal bench “will have an effect on the development of the law and on judging.”In making her argument, Judge Sotomayor sounded many cautionary notes. She said there was no uniform perspective that all women or members of a minority group have, and emphasized that she was not talking about any individual case.She also noted that the Supreme Court was uniformly white and male when it delivered historic rulings against racial and sexual discrimination. And she said she tried to question her own “opinions, sympathies and prejudices,” and aspired to impartiality.Still, Judge Sotomayor questioned whether achieving impartiality “is possible in all, or even, in most, cases.” She added, “And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society.”Read more: NYT ",fake
271,21-Jan-19,"You may know actress Patricia Heaton from the shows ‘Everyone Loves Raymond’ and ‘The Middle’ but what you might not know is that Heaton is a Christian conservative who rocks social media with close to 400K followers on Twitter.She weighed in on the Covington Catholic controversy that was wrongly reported by the leftist media as a case of Catholic students harassing a Native-American at the Lincoln Memorial in D.C. She believes as we do that the press should suffer some consequence for their horrific reporting:PATRICIA HEATON NAILS IT:I’m seeing what I believe to be sincere apologies from some journalists and verified media persons regarding their lack of professionalism in rushing to judgment re the Covington Catholic situation.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]These apologies are welcome and necessary, but they don’t address the damage that cannot be undone which was inflicted upon young people who are about to embark on adulthood – applying to colleges, looking for employment, etc.These young people will forever have these smears follow them through their life every time they proffer their resume with the word “Covington” on it. It will also affect anyone who ever has or ever will attend that school. The damage is incalculable.And yet those who perpetrated this destruction, no matter how unintended, are still at their jobs, with nary a consequence for their reckless behavior.It seems to me that an apology without some kind of accompanying action which speaks to the seriousness of their transgression – a suspension from work, some loss of pay – renders any apology empty.Some kind of compensatory action would go a long way in signaling their recognition of the seriousness of their transgression and help to restore what’s left of the public’s very fragile trust in their reputations as trustworthy journalists.However, I don’t believe this will happen.1.

273,20-Jan-19,"WOW!The Left is even meaner and more unhinged than we ever imagined.Yesterday, while a group of Covington High School boys, who participated in the March For Life in D.C., waited for their bus to pick them up and take them home, they were approached by four men in the hate group, the “New Israelites.” The New Israelites, are a group of black hate, street preachers, who spew hateful rhetoric, mostly about gays. In their description of the events that unfolded on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial yesterday, media outlets like CNN described the hate group, the “New Israelites” as a group of four black Christian men who were attacked by the MAGA hat wearing boys.At the start of the video, one of the members of the hate group can be seen standing a short distance from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, yelling at the group of MAGA hat wearing boys, saying, “See how much they respect you Israel?”Just as the New Israelite member is speaking, a group of Native Americans walks by him beating their drums, heading towards the group of boys standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The Black Israelite member, who appears to be agitating for a fight, comments to the Native Americans as they walked towards the group of boys,  “Look at them all, wearing them Make America Great Again hats! Look at their hats. Look at ’em!”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Nathaniel Phillips, who appears to be leading the group, can be seen heading towards the boys, as he beats his drum. As he gets closer, the boys notice him and begin to chant along.The Black Israelite member tells the boys, “He came to the rescue, our elder, right there. Look at him.” He then warns the group of Catholic boys, “Y’all better not touch him!”Some of the boys begin jumping up and down and appear to be joining him. The boys don’t seem to understand what is going on. Anyone watching can see that this group of older Native Americans was looking to pick a fight with these young boys. Was it their hats that caused the group to approach them? It’s hard to say, but it sure looks like that may have been the case.Here is a video clearly showing that Nathan Phillips approached the students. On the basis of the evidence we now have, I believe that people who issued categorical and one-sided condemnations of the students should retract and apologize. pic.twitter.com/GxmXcMuQgC— Matthew Schmitz (@matthewschmitz) January 20, 2019One Twitter user apologized for believing the original story, about the how it was the boys fault, after seeing how the young boy was just standing there when Phillips approached him and began banging the drum in his face.Completely different angle.I'm sorry for judging this kid. pic.twitter.com/1WXz2s2Nhw— Sandy (@RightGlockMom) January 20, 2019Meanwhile, after what happened on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial was completely misconstrued on social media and by the leftist media, the boys were unfairly targeted and attacked. The left and the leftist media immediately accused the boys of chanting “Build the Wall” in the face of this “poor Native American” man (who clearly began the confrontation when he walked into the group of young MAGA hat wearing boys on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial). They didn’t just falsely accuse them, they treated it like a blood sport, begging for people on social media to dox (reveal the identity, including where they go to school and their home addresses) the boys. It wasn’t long before they discovered the boys were from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky. After photos of each boy were pasted together, Twitter users began to share their images around, as a way to identify each individual boy.Covington Catholic Christian High school apologized for the kid's behavior.But who is going to apologize to these kids for the wrongful attack on them?Social Media was quick to investigate & Dox their identitiesBlack israelites #NathanPhillipsThey instigated the mess#MAGA pic.twitter.com/PjRmDEtAkC— ɳαɳ૮ყ ن????#Nationalist (@LVNancy) January 20, 2019By mid-afternoon today, the blood-thirsty left had the hashtag #ExposeChristianSchools trending near the top of Twitter:Fox News’s Dan Bongino called out the left for their “disgusting hashtag, calling it the most disgusting, disgraceful, horrifying, anti-America hashtag campaigns I’ve seen on this platform, #ExposeChristianSchools is the most egregious.” He continued, “Anyone promoting this atrocious garbage should hang their heads in eternal shame.”Of all the disgusting, disgraceful, horrifying, anti-American hashtag campaigns I’ve seen on this platform #ExposeChristianSchools is the most egregious.

277,18-Jan-19,"The Democrat’s armor is starting to crack.On Wednesday, Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, unwillingly revealed to Americans that Democrats are losing support for their unpopular decision to shut down the government over their refusal to fund a wall on our southern border. In a letter to President Trump, Speaker Pelosi explained that she felt his State of the Union address to the American people should be postponed until after the government is reopened. Pelosi cited “security concerns” as a reason for deciding to cancel his State of the Union speech. Unfortunately, for Nancy, Secret Service almost immediately rebuked her claim that Secret Service would be unable to do fully execute in their jobs to keep everyone safe.A reporter from The Blaze caught up with Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), to get his thoughts about the government shutdown and the efforts by House Democrats to block President Trump from his scheduled State Of The Union speech. Senator Ted Cruz laughed about Pelosi’s embarrassing efforts to keep the President from addressing the general public, saying “Nancy Pelosi is terrified, number one of her extreme left-wing base—she is captive of them.” Cruz continued, “And number two, the position of Congressional Democrats on this shutdown is objectively unreasonable. In 2013, Chuck Schumer and every Senate Democrat voted in favor of 350 miles of border wall, they have right now, shut the government down to stop 234 miles of border wall. Cruz paused, then questioned the hypocrisy of their position, “Now I don’t know how you explain why you voted for 350 miles, but you shut the government down to stop 234 miles. That is incoherent. The honest answer—It’s not a substantive disagreement” Cruz explained. “It’s a ‘their terrified’ of their extreme left wing who hates Trump—and that’s why we’re having a shutdown.”Senator Cruz pointed out that Democrats showed their hand when they canceled President Trump’s State Of The Union, suggesting Speaker Pelosi is horrified about giving President Trump the opportunity to speak directly to the American public. Cruz explained the SOTU is, “an enormous platform for the president to speak directly to the people, and she [Pelosi] doesn’t’ want people focusing on the substance of this issue.” Cruz pointed out that Speaker Pelosi would prefer that the American people’s information about the government shutdown comes instead, through the filter of the anti-Trump mainstream media.Senator Cruz claims that one of the most revealing moments in the discussions between Democrat leaders and President Trump over the funding of the wall came when President Trump invited Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). He laughed when he recalled the televised meeting Trump called with the Democrat leaders to openly air their objections in front of the American people. Cruz said, “It was a remarkable meeting. I thought the funniest and most revealing moment was when Pelosi said multiple times, please, can we turn the cameras off? Can we get the reporters out of here? She didn’t want people to see them that their position was objectively indefensible.

The part that Qasim Rashid leaves out, is that Graham was still stinging from his 1% poll ratings against President Trump during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries. He was also fully aligned at the time with the virulent anti-Trump senator, John McCain. Since that time, Graham has found himself in alignment with many of Trump’s policies and was his biggest cheerleader in the confirmation process of Justice Kavanaugh.Never mind the background or history between GOP Senator Lindsey Graham and President Trump, the Freshman Congresswoman tweets, “They got to him, he is compromised!”, suggesting that somehow, Lindsey Graham overnight became a fan of President Trump, when her accusation is not only ignorant propaganda, it is also extraordinarily reckless, considering she is a sitting U.S. Congresswoman.Here is her “gotcha” tweet:They got to him, he is compromised! https://t.co/m8sB3EmElg— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) January 16, 2019CNN host Jim Sciutto asked Omar about her tweet, as CNN placed it up on the screen for their viewers. Sciutto asked, “We need to ask you about this. I wonder if you would explain what are you talking about there. This has sparked a fair amount of criticism.”Omar, who appeared again, to be stunned by his line of questioning, responded nervously, all while trying to maintain a smile on her face, “So, over the last three years, we have seen many times where Sen. Lindsey Graham has told us how dangerous this president could be if he was given the opportunity to be in the White House and all of a sudden he’s … made a turnaround. I am pretty sure that there is something happening with him, whether it is, you know, something that has to do with his funding when it comes to running for office, whether it has something to do with the polling that they might have in his district [sic], or whether it has to do with some sort of leadership within the Senate. He is somehow compromised to no longer stand up for the truth and is fighting to protect the oath that he took in serving the American people.”Both CNN hosts seemed to be stunned when she claimed that she was “pretty sure” that “he is somehow compromised.” Sciutto appeared to be stunned by her poor explanation for her unfounded accusations, saying, “But that’s quite a charge to make. You say you’re ‘pretty sure’, based on what evidence? What facts? That’s a remarkable comment to make about a sitting U.S. Senator.”Omar then stuttered and attempted to explain her lie, “The..the…the… the evidence really is um, present to us. It’s being presented to us in the way he’s behaving.” CNN host Poppy Harlow, who appeared to be at the end of her rope with Omar, chimed in, “But that’s not evidence!

Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee’s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the “dossier.” Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn’t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it — which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn’t appear to have told his supervisors.

281,16-Jan-19,"Earlier today, Democrat Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tweeted a letter that she sent to President Trump, asking him to delay his State of The Union speech to the American people until the government reopens. In her letter, Pelosi cited “security concerns” surrounding the scheduled event. In her letter, Pelosi suggested the reason the Secret Service would be unable to effectively do their jobs to protect the President and the lawmakers, is due to the government shutdown.Here’s a portion of Nancy Pelosi’s letter to President Trump:In September 2018, Secretary Nielsen designated State of the Union Addresses as National Special Security Events (NSSEs), recognizing the need for “the full resources of the Federal Government to be brought to bear” to ensure the security of these events.  The extraordinary demands presented by NSSEs require weeks of detailed planning with dozens of agencies working together to prepare for the safety of all participants.The U.S. Secret Service was designated as the lead federal agency responsible for coordinating, planning, exercising, and implementing security for National Special Security Events by Public Law 106-544, December 19, 2000.  However, both the U.S. Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security have not been funded for 26 days now – with critical departments hamstrung by furloughs.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Sadly, given the security concerns and unless government re-opens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has re-opened for this address or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on January 29th.Along with the letter, Pelosi tweeted:“Today, I wrote to @realDonaldTrump recommending that we delay the State of the Union until after government re-opens, as the @SecretService, the lead federal agency for #SOTU security, faces its 26th day without funding.”Today, I wrote to @realDonaldTrump recommending that we delay the State of the Union until after government re-opens, as the @SecretService, the lead federal agency for #SOTU security, faces its 26th day without funding. https://t.co/K2oL8WGvqo pic.twitter.com/g3fIlxDbbK— Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) January 16, 2019Does Nancy actually think anyone believes her when she cites “security concerns” as a reason to shut down Trump’s address to the nation?  Her request to delay President Trump’s SOTU speech is an embarrassing attempt by Democrats to keep President Trump from appearing before the entire country, as he stands in front of the United States Congress,  in a clear position of power, as Nancy is forced to sit behind him, powerless to object to a single word he says.Are Nancy and her fellow Democrats concerned about President Trump using his upcoming SOTU speech to expose the hypocrisy of the Democrats who used to be in favor of funding a wall on our southern border, before Trump made the promise of building a wall on our southern border, the cornerstone of his candidacy?Democrat leaders know, that if they can stop President  Trump from fulfilling his promise of building the wall on our southern border to Americans, it will be their best chance to defeat him in 2020.  Meanwhile, for their part, the Democrat Party-aligned media refuses to demand Democrat leaders explain their opposition to funding the wall to the American people.Does Nancy actually think the Secret Service would not do their jobs because their paychecks are being delayed? Did anyone bother to ask if Nancy actually discussed the “security” issues with Secret Service or DHS?According to FOX News Chief White House correspondent, John Roberts, Nancy Pelosi is telling a bald face LIE.During an interview with Fox News host Harris Faulkner, Roberts reveals that “NOBODY” from Nancy Pelosi’s office called the Secret Service to see if there were any security concerns, saying that this is “all about politics.”Watch the incredible exchange here:Former Secret Service agent and Fox News host Dan Bongino weighed in on Pelosi’s statement, citing “security issues” at the SOTU, suggesting the Secret Service won’t be able to do their jobs because of their delayed pay.Bongino responded to Pelosi about her “grotesque political posturing”:The Secret Service is stacked with PATRIOTS, not politicians such as Speaker Pelosi.

Even before she assumes her role, Maxine has alreaday begun threatening the banks, telling them, “I’m gonna do to you what you did to us!”In 2012, when Maxine Waters was about to assume the role as chairwoman on the House Financial Services Committee, Judicial Watch wrote a scathing condemnation of the Democrats decision to place her in that powerful role, yet again:A famously corrupt—and seemingly untouchable—congresswoman renowned for abusing her power to enrich family members is set to hold a ranking position on the powerful House committee that oversees the nation’s financial services industries.Even for Washington this is a bit much. Democrats have chosen a scandal-plagued college, veteran Congresswoman Maxine Waters, to be the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee despite her many transgressions over the years. The influential congresswoman has helped family members make more than $1 million through business ventures with companies and causes that she has helped, according to her hometown newspaper.A few years ago Waters was investigated by the House Ethics Committee for steering $12 million in federal bailout funds to a failing Massachusetts bank (that subsequently got shut down by the government) in which she and her board member husband held shares. Read all about it in Waters’ profile on Judicial Watch’s 2011 “Ten Most Wanted Corrupt Politicians.” list.MAXINE IS NO FRIEND TO THE BANKS AND WALL STREET:
The Washington Times reports- Waters is no friend to the nation’s biggest banks and Wall Street, and has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and his administration. The congresswoman from California has called for more regulation of banks, and has opposed Trump’s political appointees moving to roll back regulations on banks and other financial services companies.For example, Waters, along with several other Democrats, were “no” votes on a banking industry bill that rolled back several parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the law passed under President Barack Obama that more tightly regulated banks after the financial crisis. In the Senate, the bill was supported by several Democrats and was signed into law this summer by Trump.With a Republican-controlled Senate and Trump in the White House, it is unlikely Waters‘ proposed regulations on banks will make it into law. However, it’s also much less likely that any substantial new deregulatory bills get through, either.But there are things that will be outside of the control of Waters and congressional Democrats. Most banking laws give the regulators who oversee the industry – the Federal Reserve, CFPB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others – wide authority to tailor regulations as needed. Nearly all of the positions at those regulators are now filled by Trump appointees. –In August 2010, an investigative subcommittee of the House Ethics Committee issued a Statement of Alleged Violation charging Rep. Waters with three counts of violating House rules and ethics regulations in connection with her actions regarding OneUnited.From the Citizens for Ethics – In the midst of a national financial catastrophe, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) used her position as a senior member of Congress and member of the House Financial Services Committee to prevail upon Treasury officials to meet with OneUnited Bank.  She never disclosed that her husband held stock in the bank.  This outrageous conduct has led Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) to include the congresswoman as one of the Most Corrupt Members of Congress. Rep. Waters has close financial ties to OneUnited Bank, one of the largest black-owned banks in the country. In March 2004, she and her husband, Sidney Williams, each separately bought OneUnited stock worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Additionally, Mr. Williams maintained separate holdings at OneUnited worth between $250,001 and $500,000. In September 2004, Rep. Waters sold her stock in OneUnited, and her husband sold a portion of his valued between $250,001 and $500,000. That same year, Mr. Williams joined the bank’s board, a position he retained until April 21, 2008. In addition, Mr. Williams owned 3,500 shares of OneUnited preferred stock and 476 shares of the bank’s common stock, the value of which was approximately $350,000 in June 2008. If OneUnited failed, the stock would have been worthless.On or about September 8, 2008, Rep. Waters asked then-Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson to hold a meeting with minority-owned banks to discuss losses they suffered after the government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship.10 The subsequent September 9th meeting included several senior Treasury officials, but representatives of just a single bank – OneUnited. One attendee, OneUnited’s senior counsel Robert Cooper, was then also the incoming chair of the National Bankers Association (NBA), a trade association representing minority-owned banks. Rep. Waters’ chief of staff and grandson, Mikael Moore, also attended.Kevin Cohee, chief executive officer of OneUnited, and Mr. Cooper used the meeting as an opportunity to request bailout funds.14 In a subsequent email, Mr. Cooper specifically requested more than $40 million from Treasury to compensate the bank for losses.15 At the time, the department lacked the legislative authority to bail out the bank.16 Former Bush White House officials said they were surprised when OneUnited officials asked for bailout funds because they understood the meeting had been arranged to discuss the losses minority-owned banks endured when the federal government took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.In December 2008, Rep. Waters intervened again, asking Treasury to host another meeting to ensure minority-owned banks received part of the $700 billion allocated under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The second meeting focused on minority-owned banks in general, though a OneUnited official was present. On December 19, 2008, OneUnited secured $12.1 million in bailout funds.Rep. Waters did not disclose her financial ties to OneUnited to Treasury officials when she requested meetings between regulators and bank officials. A former Bush administration official who helped set up the initial meeting stated, “[Learning of the connection] was upsetting to me. This is something that was potentially politically explosive and embarrassing to the administration. They should have at least let us know.” Treasury officials claimed that although OneUnited also requested a meeting with regulators regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac losses, it was not until the congresswoman intervened that the Treasury Department approved the initial meeting.Further, sometime in early September 2008, around the same time Rep. Waters asked the Treasury Department to hold the initial meeting, Rep. Waters spoke to Rep. Barney Frank (D- MA) about OneUnited and the fact that Mr. Williams previously had served on the board. Rep. Frank advised her to stay out of matters related to OneUnited because of her husband’s ties to the bank. Nevertheless, despite Rep. Frank’s advice, Mr. Moore continued to actively assist OneUnited representatives in their quest to receive bailout funds, and worked to craft legislation authorizing Treasury to grant OneUnited’s request.Rep. Waters defended her actions, claiming the NBA had asked her to request the initial meeting with Treasury, and she released a letter from Mr. Cooper. Neither the former chairman nor the president of the NBA, however, had been aware of Mr. Cooper’s letter, and the organization began an internal investigation.“By contacting then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to request a meeting, allegedly for a group of minority-owned banks, but then arranging for only one bank – OneUnited, in which she had a financial interest – to attend, Rep. Waters violated House conflict of interest rules,” said CREW Executive Director Melanie Sloan. – Citizens For EthicsLord Help Us!",fake

285,15-Jan-19,"According to The Hill – Two new studies, one from The Sentencing Project and one from the libertarian Cato Institute, reported that the percentage of immigrants committing crimes is lower than that of United States citizens. However, the underlying methodology used in each was critically flawed.It is possible that legal immigrants commit crimes at a rate lower than U.S. citizens and that they are incarcerated at a lower rate than U.S. citizens. After all, legal immigrants are well vetted, and if they have criminal records in their countries of origin they are generally ineligible for admission to American.The same cannot be said for illegal aliens because virtually all adult, illegal aliens commit felonies in order to procure the documents they need to get jobs, to drive and to obtain other benefits that are restricted to U.S. citizens.The vast majority of illegal aliens use fraudulently obtained Social Security numbers. They possess fake drivers’ licenses, phony “green cards,” fraudulent birth certificates and any other documents that U.S. citizens and legal residents have. In addition, they falsify I-9 forms under penalty of perjury. Thus, the average illegal alien routinely commits multiple felonies –forgery, Social Security fraud, identity theft, and perjury.This criminal activity is routinely swept under the rug in order to protect the myth of the law abiding illegal alien. However, when pushed, even the strongest supporters of illegal aliens are forced to acknowledge that the vast majority of illegal aliens commit multiple felonies. In fact, the Social Security Administration and New York Times report that approximately 75 percent of illegal aliens have fraudulently obtained Social Security numbers which is a felony. The ACLU accepts this figure and uses it to show that illegal aliens pay payroll taxes.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Furthermore, the Los Angeles Times reports that up to 8 million of 11.1 million (72 percent) illegal aliens commit job-related felonies. La Raza says that illegal aliens contribute $15 billion annually in Social Security payments through payroll taxes [by using illegally obtained Social Security numbers – felony].Neither the study from Cato or The Sentencing Project acknowledged these realities. And as a result, they tremendously understated the incidence of illegal alien criminal activity. Even the strongest supporters of illegal aliens acknowledge that 75 percent of illegal aliens routinely commit felonies of the aforementioned variety.The Cato Institute further limited its study to the incarceration rate for legal immigrants, illegal aliens and U.S. citizens. But it was forced to acknowledge that the numbers of incarcerated illegal aliens are not readily available because “local and state governments do not record whether the prisoner is an illegal immigrant.” Cato was therefore forced to “use common statistical methods to identify illegal immigrant prisoners by excluding incarcerated respondents who have characteristics that they are unlikely to have. In other words, we can identify likely illegal immigrants by looking at prisoners with individual characteristics that are highly correlated with being an illegal immigrant.”The Cato study consequently excluded felonies routinely committed by the vast majority of adult, illegal aliens as long as they were not incarcerated, resulting in a significant understatement of the overall incidence of crimes committed by illegal aliens. ",fake

After stating that she wanted a lawyer, the woman got the agent’s phone number and then slammed the door shut without waiting for him to leave. – New York PostAt the end of the conversation, the Secret Service agent attempts to leave on a good note, telling the woman who allegedly expressed how she wanted to murder our President that, “Not everybody agrees with our commander in chief,” to which she replied, “Poor f**king them!” and with that, she slammed the door in their faces.Watch:Of course, the unidentified Texas woman who allegedly threatened Trump’s life on social media isn’t the first one to get a visit from the Secret Service, several unhinged celebrities have also received visits from the Secret Service.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]On November 27, 2018, we reported about how B-Actor Tom Arnold (and we’re being generous) received a visit from the Secret Service over his vile a threatening tweet about beheading President Trump. First, Arnold challenged President Trump to a fight. Arnold’s next tweet warned President Trump that “next time Kathy won’t be holding a fake head!” Arnold’s tweet was in reference to the image that ended comedian Kathy Griffin’s career, when she held a bloodied and severed head of President Trump up for the cameras, shortly after his inauguration.Gabe Hoffman reminded Arnold that it’s a federal crime to threaten the President of the United States, along with screenshots of his vile and disgusting tweets.Hey @TomArnold, it’s a Federal crime to threaten POTUS @realDonaldTrumpYou asked him to fight you, and responded with “next time Kathy Griffin won’t be holding his fake head”, which suggested you would kill him in your proposed fight @SecretService pic.twitter.com/Mn3A9iOSRG— Gabe Hoffman (@GabeHoff) October 21, 2018The office of First Lady Melania Trump was forced to notify the Secret Service after B-actor Peter Fonda called for kidnapping Melania and Donald Trump’s son, Barron, The Daily Caller has learned exclusively.In a June 20, 2018, tweet, the actor called for Barron to be “ripped” from Melania’s arms and put in a cage “with pedophiles.”“WE SHOULD RIP BARRON TRUMP FROM HIS MOTHER’S ARMS AND PUT HIM IN A CAGE WITH PEDOPHILES AND SEE IF MOTHER WILL WILL STAND UP AGAINST THE GIANT ASSHOLE SHE IS MARRIED TO,” Fonda tweeted early Wednesday morning.And of course, there’s comedian Kathy Griffin who threw her career away when she held up a bloodied and severed head of President Trump for the cameras, during one her not very funny stunts.Kathy Griffin’s attorney says the comedian has been contacted by the Secret Service in the wake of her controversial photo shoot in which she posed with the likeness of President Donald Trump’s severed head.Attorney Lisa Bloom says Griffin has retained a criminal attorney, who also appeared at a Friday press conference in which Griffin apologized again for the images. Griffin said she is the subject of a Secret Service investigation, but did not provide any further information about the inquiry or if she was cooperating.Griffin says she will not refrain from joking about Trump in the future.Since the comedian posed with a likeness of President Donald Trump’s severed head, she has been fired from her annual gig hosting CNN’s New Year’s Eve special and several performances have been canceled at venues across the U.S.",fake

290,12-Jan-19,"President Trump is asking for $5.7 billion to fund the construction of our border wall. In 2018, the feds spent a stunning $4.173 trillion. The border wall would amount to just 1/10th of 1 percent of current annual federal spending. The Democrat Party is scared to death that if Trump is able to fulfill his promise and build the wall, there is no way they’ll be able to beat him in 2020. There’s no chance the free-spending Democrats, who typically can’t spend our money fast enough, are suddenly concerned about fiscal responsibility.The 2018 Prime Cuts report, by the watchdog group, Citizens Against Government Waste, reveals some areas where taxpayer dollars are being wasted, that could instead, be used for the construction of a wall on our southern border. According to the watchdog group, the Prime Cuts 2018 version contains 636 recommendations that would save taxpayers $429.8 billion in the first year and $3.1 trillion over five years.Grabien News compiled a list of a number of individual programs the watchdog group recommends cutting, that in and of themselves, exceed the $5.7 billion President Trump is asking the Democrat Party to give him to build the wall on our southern border.“Rural Utility Service.” This program costs taxpayers $8.2 billion/year and has no actual purpose after its original intent — bringing electricity to rural communities — was long ago achieved.Eliminating sugar subsidies alone would save $6 billion, enough to fund the border wall; it would also have the added benefit of helping curb the nation’s obesity epidemic.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Community Development Grants. These grants were created in the 70s to revitalize failing American cities. The program has almost always been plagued with dysfunction, with grants going to wealthy communities and other recipients failing to produce accountability or results. Citizens Against Government Waste reports that even President Obama called for reining in the program. Its elimination would save $15 billion over 5 years.The United Nations. As the United Nation’s largest contributor, the U.S. in 2016 donated $10 billion to the U.N. As CAGW notes, reducing these contributions just 25 percent would create a savings of $12.5 billion over 10 years. Of the money Congress appropriates for the United Nations, $5 million taxpayer dollars are itemized for abortions in foreign countries.Waste, Fraud, and Abuse. The Government Accountability Office estimates taxpayers are spending more than $137 billion annually on “payment errors,” which covers all manner of waste, fraud, and abuse within Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The feds could implement the same kind of fraud protections credit card companies used to ensure against abuse but don’t. In fact, Congress has gone in the opposite direction, winding down the program intended to police fraud within Medicare, the so-called Recovery Audit Contractor. In other words, Congress is knowingly funding tens of billions of dollars of fraud annually.These insanely wasteful programs couldn’t pay for the wall by themselves, but collectively, they sure could make a dent. Even if we take the wall out of the equation, you have to wonder who, in our government, gave the okay for these programs to be funded with our taxpayer dollars in the first place?",fake

Silva-Zuniga, an associate of the violent M3-13 gang, has been charged with secretly recording sexual encounters with a 14-year-old girl, who he coerced into having sex with him. The 52-year-old allegedly blackmailed her into having sex with him or he would reveal the compromising video to her friends.According to WJLA, court documents obtained by ABC7, the girl was a human trafficking victim within the ‘Pinos Locos’ clique of MS-13, which made the suburban town of Wheaton its hub for illegal dealings.Detectives explain the girl worked as a cocktail waitress at Lilly’s Restaurant in downtown Wheaton. Her primary duty there was to “conduct cocaine and marijuana sales, and serve alcohol to customers,” a high-ranking MS-13 member would ultimately tell detectives in exchange for more favorable treatment. “A lot of money was made for her services.”The victim told police she got into a taxi with Felix Silva-Zuniga, strictly due to fear of otherwise getting beaten again with a baseball bat. The cab dropped the duo off at a home along Bluhill Road, directly across the street from Wheaton High School.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]According to the victim, Felix led her into a basement bedroom where she told him she was only 14-years-old.

He even dropped in at Lilly’s Restaurant during her 15th birthday party.In July 2018, police arrested Silva-Zunigaoutside the Home Depot in Aspen Hill where he would solicit foreman in the parking lot of the hardware store for day work.Just another innocent “undocumented immigrant” looking to make an honest living in America…right?U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed Silva-Zuniga is living in the country illegally. Following his arrest in Montgomery County, ICE filed a deportation detainer against the Honduran native, labeling him as an “known associate of MS-13.”Silva-Zuniga faces up to 47 years in prison for seven criminal counts including sexual solicitation of a minor, child pornography-filming sex act, prurient intent, and possession of child pornography.Just another “manufactured crisis”…am I right Nancy Pelosi? ",fake

She also has some pretty stellar ideas about how he should be handling the response to the media.Rose starts out her video by revealing that she has some advice for President Trump on how he can “win the political and media war over the border wall.”Rose points out that President Trump needs to remember that he is in a position of relative strength.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]She starts out by saying that Democrat leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer made fools of themselves with their rebuttal to his address to the nation on the border crisis earlier this week. She suggests that they have made themselves the laughing stock of the public, and have destroyed their credibility with middle America.Mahgdalen also told President Trump that he needs to respond to every “stunt” by the Democrats, “who don’t play by the rules” with an “even more emotional stunt.” Rose gave President Trump examples, “Like when they had this press conference with the federal employees that were affected by the shutdown, with an even more emotionally stunning stunt.” She continued, ” So he has to have a press conference with the Angel Moms, and the families of border patrol who have been affected when their relatives have been killed.” She continued, “If Chuck and Nancy tour a migrant camp, he needs to has to have a roundtable discussion with the DACA kids who’ve been abandoned by the Democrats—Make sure to hit that.”She warns President Trump to stay away from mainstream interviews. She calls his interviews with them a “distraction,” saying it will “go poorly for him.”Rose advises him to get more people, who are on his side, to get out in front of cameras and show their support for his wall: “He needs to utilize the people from his administration who aren’t normally out there, like Ben Carson or Rick Perry.” She suggests that “anyone with name recognition, who can articulate the crisis on the southern border” needs to get out and publicly support his agenda.Rose claims President Trump needs to “localize” the issue of border security, suggesting if he can reignite local interest in the wall, Democrats will be forced to cave.Finally, she reminds Trump that he needs to call in his “political capital” and get politicians Trump helped to get elected, like Florida’s new governor, Ron DeSantis out in front of the media, showing their support for his wall.Watch this brilliant young American reveal her strategy that she claims will help President Trump to defeat the Democrats in the war for our border wall.You’re gonna love her!HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN WIN THE BORDER WALL WAR. @realDonaldTrump @mschlapp @EricTrump @KatrinaPierson @DonaldJTrumpJr @PeteHegseth @RealJamesWoods @mattgaetz @DanScavino @ScottPresler @AntonioSabatoJr @RubinReport @RobertJohnDavi @replouiegohmert @ChrisStirewalt @LouDobbs #MAGA pic.twitter.com/fQ2aVdTJbG— Mahgdalen Rose????

Rivera glossed over the deaths of innocent Americans and attempted to make an argument for protecting the illegal aliens who Barack Obama labeled “Dreamers.”When Geraldo Rivera attempted to squash Hannity’s argument about the 22 year old boy, Pierce Kennedy Corcoran of Knoxville, Tenn was killed in a deadly crash, and the Ronid Singh, the police officer who was murdered by an illegal alien, Geraldo called his argument, “grotesquely unfair” and accused Hannity of using their deaths to make a “political argument.” Rivera continued with his rant, calling Hannity’s defense of innocent Americans who’ve been killed by illegal aliens, “emotional,”That’s when frequent Fox New guest, Dan Bongino jumped in, and things really got ugly…It’s really quite ironic that a Democrat would condemn someone for using an “emotional” argument, considering that the Democrats have been ignoring facts for decades in favor of emotional arguments.While Geraldo went through the laundry list of illegal aliens used for cheap (almost slave) labor, Bongino quickly shut him down, reminding him that the argument is about innocent Americans who are killed by foreigners who have snuck across our borders and are illegally living in the United States.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Bongino had a great point when he asked about his family members who came to America legally, asking him why he’s so eager to defend those who came here illegally.

298,09-Jan-19,"Last night, during President Trump’s address to the nation on the security crisis on our southern border, the Democrat Party’s mainstream media was on high-alert for lies or misleading statements that he was certain to make.One of the most disturbing claims President Trump made last night, was about the sexual assault of women and girls as they make their way to the U.S. border from various countries including Mexico and Central America. During his address, President Trump mentioned that 30% of women and children are sexually assaulted on their way to our southern border. He was incorrect, but the media’s going to let that one go…Here’s why:NBC San Diego “fact checked” President Trump’s claim that, “One in 3 women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.” It’s interesting to note, that unlike all of the other comments made by President Trump that they diligently worked to discredit President Trump on, they never actually fact-checked President Trump’s claim about the sexual assaults of women and children. Instead of a factual rebuke, NBC News San Diego responded to Trump’s allegation by asserting that he got his information from a particular website that doesn’t line up with his numbers. As a side note, NBC San Diego doesn’t say how they know where he got his numbers from:As far as sexual assaults against women, Trump’s figure comes from Doctors Without Borders. Amnesty International has estimated it is as high as one in 6 women.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The AP also provided a lengthy “fact-check” of President Trump’s address last night but failed to address Trump’s comments about women and girls who are being sexually abused on their way to the U.S.We’ve done our own “fact check” of Trump’s claims. During our fact-checking, we discovered an unlikely source, that not only confirms Trump’s allegations of rampant sexual abuse of women and children but proves that he seriously understated the numbers of sexual assaults against women and children who make the dangerous trek to our southern border.On September 12, 2014, the anti-Trump Huffington Post published an article by Eleanor Goldberg titled:Here, is a portion of that article that was published when Barack Obama was our president, with links to check her facts.As the number of Central American women and girls crossing into the U.S. continues to spike, so is the staggering amount of sexual violence waged against these migrants who are in search of a better life.According to a stunning Fusion investigation, 80 percent of women and girls crossing into the U.S. by way of Mexico are raped during their journey. That’s up from a previous estimate of 60 percent, according to an Amnesty International report.This year alone, immigration authorities expect more than 70,000 unaccompanied minors to come through the United States unlawfully, the majority of whom are from Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The number of unaccompanied Central American girls caught at the Southwest border has rapidly outpaced the number boys, according to a July Pew Research study.Through May, the number of unaccompanied girls younger than 18 caught at the US-Mexico border increased by 77 percent. But while many of these girls are fleeing their homes because of fears of being sexually assaulted, according to the UNHCR, they are still meeting that same fate on their journey to freedom.Rape can be perpetrated by anyone along the way, including guides, fellow migrants, bandits or government officials, according to Fusion. Sometimes sex is used as a form of payment, when women and girls don’t have money to pay bribes.The assaults are so common that many women and girls take contraceptives beforehand as preventative measures.What’s particularly disconcerting is that the fact that these figures may not even represent the full grim picture.Hmmm…it would appear that the sexual assault of women and girls who make their way to our southern border is much worse than President Trump revealed.What do you think?

Maybe the @nytimesworld can inform us if #Hezbollah decorated their #terror #tunnels with Christmas trees & seasonal ornaments In 1983 Hezbollah killed 307 people which included 241 U.S. service personnel Last year, UK publication, The Spectator, caught up with the popular Imam, to find out why his message resonates with so many people of every race, origin, and religion. Imam  Mohammad Tawhidi was born in Iran and moved to Iraq when he was twelve. His father was a senior Imam in Iraq.Here is a portion of the interview with Imam Tawhidi by The Spectator:By any measure, the trajectory of Sheikh Imam Tawhidi to public prominence has been remarkable. From relative obscurity in South Australian circles, Tawhidi has become one of this country’s chief voices condemning Islamist extremism. Even if the name doesn’t immediately register, chances are that you will have seen him in the media, appearing on numerous current affair programs or contributing to the Huffington Post.Through his promotion of the harmonious elements within Islam – the moniker he runs by is, in fact, ‘The Imam of Peace’ – it would seem that Tawhidi would be an obvious poster boy for the Australian government. The Imam is young, well presented and articulate. He is charming, has successfully utilized social media and has a strong following amongst the Australian public. Perhaps most importantly to a government that yearns for unity amongst its electorate, Tawhidi is an immigrant who champions the integration of fellow expats into the Australian community. The complete package, as it were.However, there is a barrier preventing Australian elites from supporting this maverick cleric, and that is that he does not follow the liberal narrative. Instead of simply condemning obscene teachings associated with his religion, Tawhidi demands modification. Rather than apologize for shortcomings within the immigrant community, the Imam has called for immediate action, encouraging a ban on Islamic schools and Islamist organizations like Hizb’ut Tahrir. Through this, Tawhidi has even received the endorsement of none other than Ayaan Hirsi Ali – perhaps the most famous anti-Islamist (and Islamic) activist in the world – who has suggested that Tawhidi should be ‘elevated’ to sit amongst and give counsel to politicians and leaders.Tawhidi is, therefore, one of those rare public figures: a reformer who not only denounces elements of Islam but actually seeks to restructure its teachings and interpretations. However, in the current global environment, the courage to promote such ideas inevitably leads to danger; the threat of violence is so present that Tawhidi has been forced to implement constant security measures in both his professional and private life. Instead of meeting in person, we talked on the phone, with Tawhidi calling from a private number.It was during this overseas study, in 2014, that Tawhidi saw it as his duty to speak out against the questionable elements enshrined in his religion. On a sunny day in the Iraqi city of Karbala, Tawhidi was standing outside a mosque when, within earshot, a bomb exploded. As crowds ran from the scene and emergency crews rushed to help the survivors, the speakers of the mosque announced to the street below that Islamic State forces had invaded Mosul. If ever there was a time to speak out against Islamist terrorism, it was then.However, Tawhidi’s campaigning has attracted many critics within the Islamic community itself. Calling for the closure of Islamic schools is bound to court controversy, but it is his contention that Islamic teachings are the causal link to Islamist terrorist acts that seems to really rile community leaders. Following the Manchester bombing, Tawhidi appeared in a fiery TV exchange with Dr. Jamal Rifi, imploring his fellow guest to acknowledge that the Islamic holy scripture ‘teach(es) the beheading of people’.PROSECUTORS have dropped charges against a man who was accused of attacking a controversial Imam by punching him in the face and pulling his beard.The assault charges against the 22-year-old man were withdrawn in the Adelaide Magistrates Court last week.Sheikh Mohammad Tawhidi accused him of punching him in the face and pulling his beard through an open car window at the Mawson Lakes Shopping Centre in November last year.Following the assault, Imam Tawhidi told The Advertiser the attack was spurred by ideology and praised police for their help in arresting the man.“He identified me when he walked past and it was duty according to religion to attack me,” Imam Tawhidi said.“He knew what he was doing. I am in debt to the police for their help.”Imam Tawhidi has previously asked for donations so he can improve security at his home and hire bodyguards after receiving threats online and being accused of being an apostate.“My message will not change and this attack only proves me right,” he said.",fake

However, when it comes to issuing refunds, that’s not going to happen until the government completely reopens.FOX 5 ATLANTA CHIMED IN:It’s just more of an effort by the media to make a 25% shutdown of our government out to be as bad as possible.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]What the media didn’t figure is that the Trump administration would be ready with a solution…The Trump administration was on top of it so on Monday they changed the policy so that tax refunds “will go out” as planned.Even though the IRS is closed under the partial government shutdown, Americans will see tax refunds issued to them despite the fact that the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, is one of nine federal agencies affected by the shutdown.The White House Office of Management and Budget, Russel Vought, said that wouldn’t stop the IRS from issuing refunds.“Tax refunds will go out,” Vought said, according to Bloomberg.BREAKING: Budget chief Russ Vought just told reporters TAX REFUNDS WILL GO OUT despite the shutdown.— Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) January 7, 2019A big thumbs-up on that!The media also decided to share numerous photos of trash at National Parks but the great thing is volunteers decided to take it upon themselves to clean up the trash during the shutdown.So while Democrats play politics on funding the wall and the media spins it in favor of the Democrats, the Trump administration works on solutions to problems.

302,07-Jan-19,"Appointed to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, 85-year-old US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Ginsburg, has never missed a day on the court—until now. Today, for the first time in her career as a Supreme Court Justice, Ginsburg did not join her fellow justices on the bench to hear oral arguments.In 2014, liberals practically begged the then 80-year-old, Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire from the US Supreme Court, so then-President Barack Obama could appoint her successor.The  image of Ginsburg snoozing during Obama’s speech was plastered all over social media.#SOTU memories: Ruth Bader Ginsburg falls asleep http://t.co/yvYZNdXf7Z | AP Photo pic.twitter.com/FpD8n8j7fx— POLITICO (@politico) January 20, 2015Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]When she was asked why she would not step down and let former President Barack Obama replace her with another like-minded liberal justice, Ginsburg told Elle magazine’s Jessica Weisberg, that it all comes down to the Senate:Who do you think President Obama could appoint at this very day, given the boundaries that we have? If I resign any time this year, he could not successfully appoint anyone I would like to see in the court. [The Senate Republicans] took off the filibuster for lower federal court appointments, but it remains for this court. So anybody who thinks that if I step down, Obama could appoint someone like me, they’re misguided. As long as I can do the job full steam…. I think I’ll recognize when the time comes that I can’t any longer. But now I can.Ginsburg’s point is that even though Democrats control the White House and the Senate, Republicans can still block a nominee to the Supreme Court that they feel is too liberal. As she reminds those calling for her to step down, when Senate Democrats reformed the filibuster rules last year so that they could confirm judicial appointments with a simple majority vote, they made an exception for Supreme Court nominees, who would still need a 60-vote majority to break a filibuster.Did Ginsburg miss her window of opportunity to step down in 2014? Will the 85-year-old be the next Supreme Court Justice that President Trump will replace? The Democrats must certainly be in panic mode right now.On November 7, 2018, the 85-year-old far left Supreme Court Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was hospitalized after reportedly taking a nasty fall in her home. Many have been waiting for the retirement of Justice Ginsburg, who was highly critical of  Donald Trump while he was a candidate for President, and who was a huge fan of Barack Obama’s.On December 21, 2018, the 85-yr-old Supreme Court Justice underwent surgery to remove cancerous nodules from her lungs.Mike Valerio of WUSA9 tweeted a statement that was released by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding Ginsburg’s surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.The statement that was released today read:Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent a pulmonary lobectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Two nodules in the lower lobe of her left lung were discovered incidentally during tests performed at George Washington University Hospital to diagnose and treat rib fractures sustained in a fall on November 7. According to the thoracic surgeon, Valeria W. Rusch, MD, FACS, both nodules removed during surgery were found to be malignant on initial pathology evaluation. Post-surgery, there was no evidence of any remaining disease. Scans performed before surgery indicated no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body. Currently, no further treatment is planned. Justice Ginsburg is resting comfortably and is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days. Updates will be provided as they become available.But former top-rated Fox News host, Bill O’Reilly wasn’t quite as optimistic about Ginsburg’s recovery, tweeting:Justice Ginsburg is very ill. Another Justice appointment inevitable and soon. Bad news for the left.Justice Ginsburg is very ill. Another Justice appointment inevitable and soon. Bad news for the left.— Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) December 21, 2018Bill O’Reilly wasn’t the only one to call into question Ginsburg’s ability to serve on the court.While Donald Trump was running for President, Ginsburg trashed his character, saying, “He is a faker. He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. … How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.”During a New York Times interview, Ginsburg warned about a Trump presidency: “I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president.”On July 12, 2016, President Trump responded to Ginsburg’s criticism of him, calling on her to resign.Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot – resign!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 13, 2016The Daily Wire reports – Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg stated that Ginsburg, 85, who has served on the court since 1993 after being nominated by former President Bill Clinton and being confirmed by a vote of 96-3, will still peruse briefs and a transcript of the two oral arguments scheduled for Monday, according to The Washington Post.Ginsburg is a long-time survivor of cancer; she initially was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 1999; in 2009 she was diagnosed with a pancreatic cancer that was in a very early stage. Refusing to miss a day on the court, she scheduled the surgery for both problems on days when the court was not in session.What do you think?

Bale told that audience that McKay said he needed to find someone who is “absolutely charisma-free and reviled by everybody,” so he asked Bale to play the role. After winning an award for his Dick Cheney role, Bale claimed he’ll be “cornering the market on charisma-free assholes.” In another cheap shot at Republicans, Bale asked the audience if they thought he should play Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in his next role?

307,06-Jan-19,"The failing New York Times can’t help themselves. In their latest, irresponsible piece by another deranged Trump hating journalist (of which there is no shortage of at the New York Times), David Leonhardt warns that the world cannot wait for Trump to be removed from office.The easy answer is to wait — to allow the various investigations of Trump to run their course and ask voters to deliver a verdict in 2020. That answer has one great advantage. It would avoid the national trauma of overturning an election result. Ultimately, however, waiting is too dangerous. The cost of removing a president from office is smaller than the cost of allowing this president to remain.He has already shown, repeatedly, that he will hurt the country in order to help himself. He will damage American interests around the world and damage vital parts of our constitutional system at home. The risks that he will cause much more harm are growing.The biggest risk may be that an external emergency — a war, a terrorist attack, a financial crisis, an immense natural disaster — will arise. By then, it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead.For the country’s sake, there is only one acceptable outcome, just as there was after Americans realized in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the Oval Office. The president must go.The arrogant liberal journalist warns, “For the country’s sake, there is only one acceptable outcome,” leaving the reader to believe that his opinion trump’s (pun intended) those of the 62,979,636 Americans who voted for Donald Trump to lead our nation. Did it ever occur to Mr. Leonhardt that President Trump’s supporters are quite satisfied with the direction of our nation since Trump became our fearless leader? Yes, I did say, “fearless.” As a suburban, working woman, and mother, I couldn’t be more thrilled to have a President with a backbone, who is willing to stand up to the self-serving Socialist-Democrats and phony Republicans in the D.C. swamp. Every day, I feel safer knowing that our President is willing to stand up to the evil dictators, who spent eight years rattling the cage of Barack Obama, and threatening our national security, while our “fearless leader” met with Al Sharpton and Black Lives Matter in the White House, plotting their next move in their war on law enforcement.Leonhardt then attempts to prove that virtually everyone, including those closest to President Trump, despise him…Consider the following descriptions of Trump: “terribly unfit;” “erratic;” “reckless;” “impetuous;” “unstable;” “a pathological liar;” “dangerous to a democracy;” a concern to “anyone who cares about our nation.” Every one of these descriptions comes from a Republican member of Congress or of Trump’s own administration.They know. They know he is unfit for office. They do not need to be persuaded of the truth. They need to be persuaded to act on it.David Leonhardt’s op-ed was released to the applause of the Trump Derangement crowd today, and at least for now, he is a hero. But does David Leonhardt or anyone on the editorial staff at the New York Times ever consider the consequences of their hit-pieces on our President, and by extension, his supporters in Congress? What about the 63 million people who elected him? What about that time when a deranged gunman met GOP members on a certain softball field in D.C. and began shooting them? What about GOP Representative Steve Scalise, who came dangerously close to losing his life at the hands of a deranged leftist?Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Trump Derangement Syndrome is real, and the failing New York Times is doing their part to keep gasoline flowing on the Trump hating fire. One has to wonder if anti-Trump publications like the New York Times and CNN are putting President Trump and his supporters in real danger with his leftist opinion and “removal” rhetoric?Leonhardt’s New York Times op-ed is so popular with the Trump Derangement crowd, that “Donald J. Trump” has been trending at the top of Twitter all day.If you click on “Donald J. Trump” to see why it’s trending, you’ll see quotes from Leonhardt’s NYT’s op-ed like these:“Trump: “terribly unfit;” “erratic;” “reckless;” “impetuous;” “unstable;” “a pathological liar;” “dangerous to a democracy;” a concern to “anyone who cares about our nation.” Every one of these comes from a Republican.”Tim O’Brien, executive editor at Bloomberg tweets: “The United States has never had a president as demonstrably unfit for the office as Trump. And it’s becoming clear that 2019 is likely to be dominated by a single question:I don’t know, because I’m not a deranged Trump hater, but if I were, these sure seem like trigger words to me. RestoreLeadershipNow quotes from Leonhardt’s New York Times op-ed, where Leonhardt warns of the urgency to remove President Trump from office, urging that the world cannot wait.“The biggest risk may be that an external emergency — a war, a terrorist attack, a financial crisis, an immense natural disaster — will arise. By then, it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead.”Again, I’m not a deranged Trump hating leftist, but if I were, these warnings seem rather ominous, almost giving the impression that something needs to be done about Trump NOW. Novelist Zoe Sharp wrote the following narrative of the president’s assassination:The president didn’t seem to notice. He waved, in his desultory fashion. The Secret Service agents clustered around him, ushered him toward the armored limo idling outside at the curb.The Russian waited until they were a few steps past before he drew the gun. He sighted on the center of the president’s back, and squeezed the trigger.The Makarov misfired.The Secret Service agent at the president’s shoulder heard the click, spun into a crouch. He registered the scene instantly, drawing his own weapon with razor-edge reflexes.The Russian tasted failure. He closed his eyes and waited to pay the cost.It did not come.He opened his eyes. The Secret Service agent stood before him, presenting his Glock, butt first.“Here,” the agent said politely. “Use mine. …”The Times explained the reason for publishing the fictional piece:Our focus here at the Book Review is on books and stories, but also on how the books being written and read reflect the world outside of books. And one of the biggest stories out there, of course, is the Mueller investigation and the relationship between Trump and Putin. It’s hard not to speculate about what might happen next. To that end, we thought: Who better than some of today’s most talented spy and crime novelists — Joseph Finder, Laura Lippman, Jason Matthews, Zoë Sharp and Scott Turow — to conjure possible outcomes?Following their op-ed, Scalise published an op-ed and also released a statement to DCNF regarding the New York Times article with a story about assassinating our president.“The media needs to take accountability for the role they are playing in promoting dangerous rhetoric and division in this country, particularly against President Trump and his supporters,” Scalise said. The decision by The New York Times to run this piece is irresponsible and offensive, and they should remove it and apologize.”Now, Western Journal is reporting that someone or some group is posing as VP Mike Pence’s press secretary, in what looks like an attempt to discover the whereabouts of GOP lawmakers. The FBI is calling it a security threat.The press secretary for Vice President Mike Pence was the subject of an impersonation attempt in which someone sent text messages to Republican members of Congress as the press secretary Alyssa Farah.The text messages were seeking information about the whereabouts of the Congress, according to CNN, and the FBI was investigating the matter, CNN reported.According to The Wall Street Journal, the impersonator requested meetings with the lawmakers“At least one member has repeatedly been engaging with the imposter,” The Journal reported.The White House is treating this incident as a potential security threat, the Washington Examiner reported.",fake

311,03-Jan-19,"Yesterday, in a New York Times article, Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign came under fire, after it was accused of sexual harassment, sexism, and unequal pay for women.In February 2016, Giulianna Di Lauro, a Latino outreach strategist for Senator Bernie Sanders’s presidential operation, complained to her supervisor that she had been harassed by a campaign surrogate whom she drove to events ahead of the Democratic primary in Nevada.She said the surrogate told her she had “beautiful curly hair” and asked if he could touch it, Ms. Di Lauro said in an interview. Thinking he would just touch a strand, she consented. But she said that he ran his hand through her hair in a “sexual way” and continued to grab, touch and “push my boundaries” for the rest of the day.“I just wanted to be done with it so badly,” she said.When she reported the incident to Bill Velazquez, a manager on the Latino outreach team, he told her, “I bet you would have liked it if he were younger,” according to her account and another woman who witnessed the exchange. Then he laughed.Accounts like Ms. Di Lauro’s — describing episodes of sexual harassment and demeaning treatment as well as pay disparity in Mr. Sanders’s 2016 campaign — have circulated in recent weeks in emails, online comments and private discussions among former supporters. Now, as the Vermont senator tries to build support for a second run at the White House, his perceived failure to address this issue has damaged his progressive bona fides, delegates and nearly a dozen former state and national staff members said in interviews over the last month.“I certainly apologize to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately, and, of course, if I run, we will do better next time.”Watch:CNN's Anderson Cooper asks Bernie Sanders about alleged sexual misconduct that happened on his campaign: ""Just to be clear, you seemed to indicate that you did not know at the time about the allegations.

313,02-Jan-19,"They’re coming (illegally) to America—and they’re bringing TB, flu, parasites and all kinds of diseases with them. Thousands of illegal aliens are attempting to illegally cross our southern border from Mexico. Many of them are very ill. Is President Trump responsible for the deaths of people with serious illnesses who make it across our border? If they’re able to sneak across our border, should American taxpayers be on the hook for their healthcare costs? What about the pregnant women who successfully make it across our border? Should American citizens be responsible for the cost to birth their children, who then become citizens?According to the Washington Times – Border authorities are referring 50 people a day for urgent medical care, including tuberculosis, flu and even pregnant women about to give birth, a top official said Monday, saying it’s unlike anything they’ve ever seen before.The numbers were released after a full review was done of all children in the custody of Customs and Border Protection in the wake of two illegal-immigrant children who died in U.S. hospitals in December.CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said most of those needing help were ill when they arrived at the border, and some appear to have made the initial decision to leave even while ailing.Agents have spotted a new trend in the traffic from Central America to the U.S., with smuggling organizations using commercial buses to get people through the journey in less than a week. That’s far faster than the 25 to 30 days it takes most migrants who walk or take a mixture of transportation to get from Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras through Mexico and to the border.
Mr. McAleenan said the commercial buses are also delivering migrants to parts of the border such as western Texas and New Mexico that have traditionally been less afflicted by the flow of immigrants crossing into the U.S. illegally.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The faster trip also makes it easier for sick people to come, and provides “confidence for parents to bring younger children” along as well, he said.The deaths of a 7-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy in CBP custody in December have drawn fierce criticism, with some Democrats and a number of immigrant-rights groups saying the agency has blood on its hands.The girl arrived with her father as part of a group of more than 160 people at a remote part of the border in New Mexico, hours from the nearest Border Patrol station. Her father at first told agents she was healthy, but later alerted them when she began to vomit and then lose consciousness.Agents revived her twice and she was flown by air ambulance to a hospital where she later died after suffering major organ failure.
The boy died Christmas Eve after six days in CBP custody, having been transferred to multiple facilities because of overcrowding due to the new surge of people.His initial illness was diagnosed at a hospital as a common cold, then he was deemed to have a fever. He was treated and released, but hours later, back at a border holding facility, he vomited.His father declined medical attention, but an agent during a later welfare check said the boy looked ill and had him taken back to the hospital, where he died.The boy’s mother, back in Guatemala, told Reuters news agency they had been told by neighbors that if he brought the child, the father would get more lenient treatment by U.S. authorities and would be quickly released into the U.S. where he could disappear into the shadows, live in the U.S. illegally and find work.According to the Spectator, the cost of the border wall has been projected by numerous entities, and the estimates vary wildly. The Trump administration and the GOP congressional leadership have estimated its cost at $12 billion to $15 billion. Senate Democrats claim that the price tag would be $67 billion. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has projected the cost at $21.6 billion. Going with the Trump administration figure, the savings to our health care system should pay for the thing in a decade. Using the DHS figure, it will take far less time than a typical mortgage. Specifically, about 20 years.This depends on what we pay for the health care we provide to illegal immigrants and how many will be stopped by the wall. Neither of these figures is easy to calculate, but it’s clear that most estimates we see in the media understate both. To hit the payoff goals noted above we would need to stop 500,000 people per year from illegally entering the country and eliminate an equal number from the Medicaid and Obamacare rolls. That would save $1.3 billion annually in medical costs. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, we spend nearly twice that on illegal aliens for emergency Medicaid alone:Federal law generally bars illegal immigrants from being covered by Medicaid. But a little-known part of the state-federal health insurance program for the poor has long paid about $2 billion a year for emergency treatment for a group of patients who, according to hospitals, mostly comprise illegal immigrants.Most of this money pays for delivering babies when patients materialize in emergency rooms in active labor. Pursuant to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), all hospitals must provide emergency medical treatment to all comers regardless of ability to pay or any other consideration. It is common for women of obviously foreign descent and no English to appear in ERs just as they are about to give birth. Hospitals cannot turn them away (and wouldn’t do so if they could). Medicaid retroactively covers them and pays some of the treatment costs.",fake
314,02-Jan-19,"Elections have consequences…Before they left for recess in December, Senate Democrats decided it was worth the political gamble, to shut down the government, as a way to embarrass President Trump over his very public efforts to fund a wall on our southern border. After Democrats refused to sign off on a Continuing Resolution bill that would fund a wall on our southern border, they began a campaign to shame President Trump for standing firm on his campaign promise to secure our borders from criminals, terrorists, and foreigners who bilk American taxpayers out of billions of dollars every year in taxpayer-funded benefits.Democrats, who don’t want to risk being outed again for their opposition to our nation’s security, or to be forced to have to deal with future objections from pesky Republican lawmakers over raising our nation’s debt ceiling, are currently working on new House rules that would automatically raise the nation’s debt ceiling without a vote. They’re calling it a way to “restore regular order and bring integrity back” to the House.According to NPR – Top Democrats announced late Sunday a series of changes to House rules that could eliminate causes of major instability during the previous eight years of Republican rule in Congress.“We are proposing historic changes that will modernize Congress, restore regular order and bring integrity back to this institution,” said incoming House Rules Chairman James McGovern, D-Mass., in a statement explaining the changes.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Democrats will revive the “Gephardt Rule,” introduced in the late 1970s by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., that automatically raises the debt ceiling — the nation’s borrowing limit — once the House passes a budget.House Republicans preferred to force votes to approve debt ceiling increases in an effort to bring more accountability and political pressure to reduce the nation’s deficit and debt. However, that decision never resulted in reducing spending and only added to a culture of brinksmanship in recent years that often threatened the U.S. into default on its debts and increased economic uncertainty around the globe.Additionally, Democrats are changing the rules regarding motions “to vacate the chair,” a procedural tool that could be used to force out a sitting House speaker. It is the procedural weapon that conservatives led by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., were planning to use to try to oust Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in 2015 before he made the decision to step down.Democrats plan to tweak the rules so that a motion to vacate can only be offered on the House floor if a majority of either the House Republican Conference or the House Democratic Caucus agrees to do so. The change limits the ability of any one member to wreak havoc on the floor and ultimately bolsters incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against potential agitators in either party.o",fake

One of the most interesting lines in the interview came after the Trump bashing where the outed sexual predator tells Colbert, “I wouldn’t take it back.

Then last year America learned that when C.K. said “constant perverted sexual thoughts … make me into a moron,” he wasn’t actually joking.A New York Times story forced C.K., 50, to confess to longstanding rumors that he had brought female comics back to his hotel room and masturbated in front of them. And while he was spotted at the Olive Tree Cafe (the restaurant above the Comedy Cellar) in February, the king of stand-up has been banished since the scandal broke. “Everybody dropped him,” says Louis Faranda, executive talent producer for Carolines, “which was the right thing to do.”In August 2018, Handler’s Netflix show was canceled.

Comedian George Lopez was charged with battery in the incidentGEORGE LOPEZ was at a Hooters in New Mexico when a guy approached him and eventually mentioned President Trump in what he calls a “joke”. George Lopez grabbed the guy by the neck and tried to grab his phone. According to the police report, Lopez said he attacked the guy because he didn’t want to be filmed. Lopez is now facing charges over this incident. Lopez has been a rabid critic of the president in the past. This feels like a bit of Karma coming to this anti-Trump comedian.The unhinged Trump supporter was supposed to be the highlight at the April 2018 White House Correspondent’s Dinner. After the so-called comedian, who was hired to entertain anti-Trump journalists, brutally attacked the only two women in President Trump’s administration who were in attendance at the event, she used her newfound notoriety to promote her upcoming Netflix Show, “The Break.”The next day, thousands of Americans took to social media to express their outrage over her invitation to the event that was filmed live on CSPAN. From her joke about wishing a tree would fall on Kellyanne Conway, to repeatedly calling Sarah Huckabee Sanders a “liar”, as she sat uncomfortably next to her at the podium, most people didn’t find Wolf to be even remotely funny.Jim Carrey, who hasn’t performed in a hit movie in a decade, has spent most of the past two years painting hate-filled images of President Trump.

And now, the former “funny girl” is telling anyone who will listen, that she’s furious no one wants to hire her.After the comedian couldn’t find anyone who wanted to hire the comedian, Griffin made a homemade 5-minute video, where she whined to viewers about all of the online “hate” by “trolls.” Griffin also trashed the other “not funny” comedian Lena Dunham, who wrote about sexually assaulting her little sister. In her video, she seemed to be attempting to make the point that the equally trashy, liberal, anti-Trump comedian, Lena Dunham, is still getting work, and how Griffin just doesn’t think that it’s fair. (After all, Dunham hates Trump as much as her…right?)Finally, Griffin moaned about not being able to get a Netflix show on Twitter.I can't get a Netflix special because I once had the audacity to share that a Netflix executive told me that because they had Chelsea Handler, they didn't need other women…Meanwhile, Norm Macdonald has a Netflix talk show….Double Standard?

Today, in fulfilling that responsibility, I have decided to revoke the security clearance of John Brennan, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Historically, former heads of intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been allowed to retain access to classified information after their government service, so that they can consult with their successors regarding matters about which they may have special insights, and as a professional courtesy.

Within EU countries, the figure is around 19million.In the EU, Germany and France have the biggest Muslim populations, both being home to around 4.7million. By contrast, the UK has about 2.9million Muslims – the third largest number.However, at 7.5 percent of the population, France has the highest proportion of Muslims of any major nation in Western Europe. Studies suggest this will pass 10 percent by 2030. Muslims make up 6 percent of the population in the Netherlands, 5.9 percent in Belgium, 5.8 percent in Germany and 4.8 percent in the UK.The French capital of Paris and its metropolitan area also has more Muslims than any other city in the EU – an estimated 1.7million. This is partly due to the legacy of the bitter war for Algeria, France’s Muslim former colony, in the 1950s.Tensions surrounding France’s Muslim community have long been simmering in the banlieues – vast concrete slums dominated by immigrants.BBC reports – A ban on saying prayers in the street, a practice by French Muslims unable to find space in mosques, has come into effect in the capital, Paris.Interior Minister Claude Gueant has offered believers the use of a disused fire brigade barracks instead.The phenomenon of street prayers, which see Muslims spreading mats on footpaths, became a political issue after far-right protests.France is home to the biggest Muslim minority in Western Europe.By some estimates, as many as six million French people, or just under 10% of the population, are Muslims, with origins in France’s former North African colonies.Their integration has been a source of political debate in recent years, and earlier this year France became the first EU state to ban the wearing of the Islamic veil in public.The new ban came into force at midnight on Thursday, in time for traditional Muslim Friday prayers.Far right protests at the “Islamisation” of the Goutte d’Or district began last year and in December the leader of the French National Front, Marine Le Pen, accused Muslim fundamentalists of using prayers for political ends.She controversially compared the practice to the Nazi wartime occupation of France.",fake

Furgeson claimed that Casey found the Xhale City vape store clerk’s behavior to be “abhorrent.” Casey looked into the camera, and called the Xhale City vape store clerk’s behavior, “disgusting,” adding “you don’t treat people like that.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Furgeson held his camera on both of them saying, “Okay, so here we are—a liberal Democrat” Casey interrupts to say “Not a Trump supporter at all,” Furgeson continued, “and a conservative Republican.” Furgeson turned to his “friend Casey” and asked her if she’s ever been in trouble with the law? Casey responded that she had not been in trouble with the law. Furgeson admitted he’s “a five-time felon and a convict” and explained that even though Casey has never been in trouble with the law, they were “coming together,” as they hugged. Casey replied, “We’re cool as shit.” Furgeson was clearly attempting to prove the point that it doesn’t matter what your political views are, or even your past history with the law, you can still get along.

They also stated that as soon as they identified their unhinged and intolerant employee in the now viral video, they immediately fired him. The Xhale City statement also revealed that they have spoken with the customer and apologized, saying they “value their clients” and “treat them with respect and dignity, regardless of their political views.”Americans are better than this.

No American should be forced to endure the rants or threats of an ignorant, violent and intolerant liberal. Kudos to Ian Furgeson for videotaping this interaction. Who knows, the next would-be unhinged victim of Trump Derangement Syndrome might think twice about assaulting or refusing service to their fellow American simply for the “crime” of supporting our President of the United States.It goes without saying that this would be a massive story if the Trump supporter was an Obama supporter, and this incident took place in 2010.What do you think?

320,28-Dec-18,"While lawmakers grapple with how to deal with the censorship of conservatives by tech giants, Facebook, Twitter and Google, a new report by a group called imge., reveals that email providers may also be working behind the scenes to tilt the scales in favor of Democrats and against Republicans, ultimately affecting the outcome of critical elections.imge., a full-service digital firm founded in 2013 that specializes in designing and executing integrated digital campaigns wondered if email providers were attempting to influence the outcome of elections, so they decided to run a test and find out. The results are nothing short of stunning.imge. asked:Is the world of email biased against conservatives?Many partisans often mutter such an accusation against Silicon Valley. Yet, few digital professionals take the time to investigate whether such a bold claim is true.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Poor email deliverability doesn’t just suppress a candidate’s message, it decreases the engagement of campaign supporters. That means fewer donations, fewer volunteers, and fewer advocates. If Republicans underperform in email deliverability, they face a disadvantage on Election Day.So we decided to test the rumors. Our team created email addresses with different email providers and signed up for the email lists of around fifty different candidates, committees, and political nonprofits. In the month leading up to the election, we tracked how many emails were sent from each entity, and what percentage of those emails made it into our inbox. To keep it consistent, we opened every email, every day – regardless of where it was placed.*To put these numbers in perspective, let’s examine two closely contested Senate races.In Nevada, Democrat Jacky Rosen averaged over 90% placement in inboxes, compared to Dean Heller’s over 90% placement in spam.In Florida, 100% of Republican Rick Scott’s emails went to spam in Yahoo, while 100% of Bill Nelson’s emails went to our Yahoo inbox.While these were the most dramatic examples, this pattern emerged in every toss-up Senate race we trackedOne might ask: well, were these conservatives spamming their supporters? Across the five toss-up Senate races we tracked, Democrats sent over four times the quantity of emails than their Republican opponents. Only one Senate candidate used a double opt-in, and it was a Republican: Kevin Cramer, who performed the best among the Republicans.Making it into inboxes, however, takes more than sending the right amount of email. Email deliverability is a complex animal. List quality, content quality, knowledge of best practices, proper verifications – all of these factors feed into whether an email goes into the spam folder.To be sure, some accusations of “bias” against conservatives on digital platforms can be attributed to a lack of digital sophistication. But these findings are consistent across multiple entities serviced by multiple professional firms. The answer to this disparity might be structural bias, bad strategy, or some blend of both. Regardless of the reason, it is clear that Republicans need to find this answer to remain competitive in email marketing.According to imge., email is a significant part of their overall strategy to promote a political candidate. Imagine their shock to find out email providers may be acting as gatekeepers to determine which political candidate’s message can or cannot be viewed in their email box.*Our method for conducting this study was simple. First, we selected candidates from top party targets due to seat vulnerability. We leaned on Roll Call’s 10 Vulnerable House Members and Senators for candidate selection, and then added in party leadership and party committees. We added in three organizations from each side of the political aisle, as well as three non-partisan organizations, to round out our study. The full list can be found here. Then we created four email addresses (Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, and Outlook) and signed up for their email lists. Most lists required an email and zip code, so we signed up with our Virginia office zip code so that we would be put on the national lists for all candidates.To ensure consistency, we opened every single email in the inbox and spam folders, but we did not click on anything within the emails. We checked each inbox on a daily basis like most users would so that it would be as organic as possible. This study ran from October 4-November 6.We tracked the following in spreadsheets:1. Date we received the email
2. Sending URL/domain
3. Sender name
4. Sender email
5. Inbox placement (Inbox or Spam/Junk)We were unable to use the data from Outlook for this blog post, because Outlook has a feature that deleted emails in the Junk folder if they were there for more than 30 days. So by the time we were finishing entering in our data to the spreadsheet, too many emails in the Junk folder were unrecoverable.The only campaign or organization that asked us to double opt-in was Kevin Cramer for Senate (R-ND).",fake

The CBP has released news of a diagnosis of the flu. The outrage from the left is sickening because the border patrol did everything they could for this child.We’d like to set the record straight on this.The father of the boy is the one who put his child in harm’s way by making the very dangerous journey to our border. Why would a parent make the journey with a child?Well, as usual, our government has incentivized bad behavior (see video below). The word is out in Central America (see below) that illegals can pass through to the United States easier than if they are childless. This is nothing new but just being reported by the New York Post in the wake of the death of the 8-year-old son of a Guatemalan man:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Via NY Post: GUATEMALA CITY — The father of an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy who died in U.S. custody took his son to the border after hearing rumors that parents and their children would be allowed to migrate to the United States and escape the poverty in their homeland, the boy’s stepsister told The Associated Press.Felipe Gomez Alonzo died Monday at a New Mexico hospital after suffering coughing, vomiting and fever, authorities said. It was the second such death this month. Another Guatemalan child, 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, died in U.S. custody on Dec. 8. Both deaths are under investigation.“We heard rumors that they could pass (into the United States). They said they could pass with the children,” said Catarina Gomez Lucas, the boy’s 21-year-old stepsister, explaining why Felipe and his father, Agustin Gomez, made the dangerous journey.Gomez Lucas would not say who spread the rumors or who transported the father and son to the border from Yalambojoch in Huehuetenango province, a poor community of returnees from Mexico who had fled Guatemala in the bloodiest years of that country’s 1960-1996 civil war. The stepsister spoke to the AP on Wednesday by telephone from Yalambojoch.THIS IS NOTHING NEW – THE WORD WAS OUT THAT MEN COULD “PASS” WITH CHILDREN:We reported on the rumors swirling around that Obama would let the children into the U.S. beginning during his presidency. THE REPORT BELOW IS FROM JULY 0F 2015:The illegal alien family units are coming in large numbers. It’s a second wave of illegals who hope to “pass”. The huge surge is due to word getting back that it’s safe to “pass”. Here’s a quote from a Honduran illegal who came over the border successfully:Elsa: I didn’t know if he could cross with my daughter or with a male. They told me that it would be easier if I crossed.
Reporter: Why?
Elsa: I don’t know. a lot of people say if a woman crosses with a boy, they’ll let them pass. but I didn’t know that a man could pass, that a male could pass with a baby and now that I came, on my journey, I saw men pass with babies.Elsa confirmed she is going to tell her husband to make the journey to the U.S.Here’s Charlie LeDuff with a MUST WATCH VIDEO of first-hand border crossing and what the cost is to us: 700 BILLION DOLLARS SINCE 9/11! Watch at the 2:50 point where a 12-year-old and his mother were arrested then processed and then “given a bus ticket to Los Angeles” paid for by YOU the taxpayer.

JEH JOHNSON SPEAKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF HIS MOUTH…LIARThe article below is from December of 2015.The American taxpayer is on the hook for the millions and millions it costs to house and feed illegals. Record numbers came here with over 10,000 in October and November. This is unbelievable! You can blame the Obama policy for this:PLEASE WATCH THIS SHOCKING VIDEO:
OBAMA POLICY PAYING MILLIONS TO TAKE IN ILLEGALS:WFAA found this:As the newest surge of refugee South American children begins arriving soon in North Texas, everything from food to clothing, counseling and medical services will be provided by the nonprofit group BCFS. But, records show, taxpayers will be footing the bill.Long before the buses of workers who will care for immigrant children rolled into North Texas today, San Antonio-based BCFS was tapped by the Obama administration to provide temporary shelters in North Texas at taxpayer expense. How much is this going to cost? Neither BCFS nor the U.S. Health and Human Services department could say today.But, an online database search of federal contracts and grants shows that there was a spike in payments to the group coinciding with last year’s surge of unaccompanied minors.According to USAspending.gov, BCFS received $296 million to administer the government’s “Unaccompanied Alien Children Program” nationwide over the past three fiscal years.“The costs for temporary shelter operations, medical care, security, room and board are requested, vetted, proposed and authorized for by the federal government,” said Krista Piferrer, BCFS spokeswoman. “All expenses are based on cost-reimbursement, which means funds are drawn down only when goods/services are requested and expended.”What the records don’t show is exactly what the money bought, or where it was spent.We do know one area where BCFS has spent dollars, though.According to the Center for Responsive Politics, BCFS, which used to be called Baptist Child & Family Services, has spent $210,000 on lobbying lawmakers since 2006.RECORD NUMBER OF ILLEGAL MINORS IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER OF 2015: The Department of Homeland Security has told Congress that for the past six years it has deported just six percent of youths who entered the country illegally, an enormous policy failure that illegal immigrants are seizing on to encourage friends and relatives to raid the border.Getting into the United States is so easy, and staying here a cinch, that illegals are even telling U.S. Border Patrol officials that they know they will be freed and are using social media to send home photos of their “permisos,” documents that set them free.“Border Patrol agents have confirmed that the new arrivals are saying that they know they will be released after they are processed,” said Jessica M. Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies. “They have heard this from family and friends who have gone before and shared their experience. They use social media to communicate this, sometimes even texting pictures of what they call their ‘permiso,’ which is the document they get showing them to appear for a court date years in the future,” she told Secrets.According to a Congress report, DHS told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that since 2009, it has apprehended some 122,700 unaccompanied children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. But it has only “repatriated” about 7,700, or 6 percent.When added to the administration’s practice of releasing most illegal minors who promise to eventually show up at an immigration court hearing and a judge’s order to close some detention centers, those looking to flee troubled Latin countries believe that once they get across the border that they are “home free,” said a report on the issue from the Senate Homeland panel headed by Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.A new surge of crossings by minors on the border appear to prove that out, according to Vaughan.When asked about a new report on the surge and what was fueling it, she said, “I believe that part of the reason for the new surge is that the smugglers now can assure their potential customers that they will no longer face a possibility of extended detention after being processed by the Border Patrol, because a federal judge has ordered DHS to close the family and child detention centers.”Vaughan, the Center’s director of policy studies, said that Border Patrol agents have revealed that new arrivals know they will be released once processed and use social media to spread the word in Latin America.Via: WE",fake

No, we’re not kidding. This has been reported by many different news sources.All Americans should see what’s been going on for years… LONG before President Trump came into office. The illegals are working the system to overload it because they know when the system is overloaded, ICE has no choice but to release them in the US to go wherever they want to go. This policy is ridiculous and isn’t fair to the American taxpayers who foot the bill for this nonsense.We reported (see below) during the Obama administration on busloads of illegals being dropped off in border towns because of overcrowding at detention centers. Yes, this really is a plan to overwhelm the immigration system in order to allow the illegals to infiltrate America.It’s being reported by CNN of all news sources that illegals were dropped off by ICE with NO WARNING to the town of El Paso, Texas!On Christmas Eve, hundreds of illegals were dropped with hundreds more to come tomorrow!THE EL PASO NEWS IS REPORTING THAT 2,000 WILL BE DROPPED OFF BY WEEKS END:Annunciation House Director Ruben Garcia said the nonprofit organization that helps immigrants expected to receive about 200 migrants in all on Christmas Day. Another 500 migrants are expected both Wednesday and Thursday. Garcia says there should be a total of 2,000 by the end of this week. One of the illegals interviewed by the local news claims his reason for coming to the US is that it’s hard to find a job where he’s from in Central America. THAT IS NOT A REASON FOR ASYLUM! The US is becoming a dumping ground for third-world sh*tholes.The policy of just dropping these people off needs to end now. What nation just allows illegals to infiltrate thousands at a time?CNN reports:Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dropped off more than 200 undocumented immigrants outside a Greyhound bus terminal in El Paso, Texas, on Sunday night without an apparent plan for housing them, according to Sgt. Robert Gomez, a spokesman with the El Paso Police Department.Police were first notified of the crowd at about 8 p.m. by officials at the bus terminal, who said individuals were trying to board buses without tickets“All of a sudden a bunch of people show up; ICE drops them off,” said Greyhound spokeswoman Crystal Booker. “We weren’t expecting it. We are not given prior notice.”
The waiting area at the bus terminal is small, Gomez said, and many people were left standing outside in the cold. He said the group of 211 undocumented immigrants included some families and small children.CNN PROPAGANDA:CNN plays it off like this is a terrible thing to do to these “undocumented immigrants” but we want to know why the heck hundreds of illegals are just allowed to leave detention? They claim overcrowded conditions are to blame and that the feds can’t keep the illegals past a certain time then WHY HASN’T THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS CHANGED THE POLICY?IN JUNE OF 2016, WE REPORTED ON VAN LOADS OF ILLEGALS BEING RELEASED:The insanity continues! The outrageous invasion on our southern border has been so out of control in the past seven years but it’s gotten to crisis mode recently with a HUGE surge in illegals from all over the world. Yes, we’ve become a GLOBAL MAGNET for anyone to cross our border. Soooo what’s the reason for the illegals to be released? You’ll never believe it! It’s because the detention centers are FULL! No kidding! The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is quietly transporting illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to Phoenix and releasing them without proper processing or issuing court appearance documents, Border Patrol sources tell Judicial Watch.The government classifies them as Other Than Mexican (OTM) and this week around 35 were transferred 116 miles north from Tucson to a Phoenix bus station where they went their separate way. Judicial Watch was present when one of the white vans carrying a group of OTMs arrived at the Phoenix Greyhound station on Buckeye Road.
The OTMs are from Honduras, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala and Border Patrol officials say this week’s batch was in custody for a couple of days and ordered to call family members in the U.S. so they could purchase a bus ticket for their upcoming trip from Phoenix. Authorities didn’t bother checking the identity of the U.S. relatives or if they’re in the country legally, according to a Border Patrol official directly involved in the matter. American taxpayers pick up the fare for those who claim to have a “credible fear,” Border Patrol sources told JW. None of the OTMs were issued official court appearance documents, but were told to “promise” they’d show up for a hearing when notified, said federal agents with firsthand knowledge of the operation.A security company contracted by the U.S. government is driving the OTMs from the Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector where they were in custody to Phoenix, sources said. The firm is called G4S and claims to be the world’s leading security solutions group with operations in more than 100 countries and 610,000 employees. G4S has more than 50,000 employees in the U.S. and its domestic headquarters is in Jupiter, Florida. Judicial Watch is filing a number of public records requests to get more information involving the arrangement between G4S and the government, specifically the transport of illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to other parts of the country. The photo accompanying this story shows the uniformed G4S guard that transported the OTMs this week from Tucson to Phoenix.Outraged Border Patrol agents and supervisors on the front lines say illegal immigrants are being released in droves because there’s no room to keep them in detention. “They’re telling us to put them on a bus and let them go,” said one law enforcement official in Arizona. “Just move those bodies across the country.” Officially, DHS denies this is occurring and in fact earlier this year U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske blasted Border Patrol union officials for denouncing this dangerous catch-and-release policy. Kerlikowske’s scolding came in response to the congressional testimony of Bandon Judd, chief of the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union that represents line agents. Judd told lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee that illegal immigrants without serious criminal convictions can be released immediately and disappear into the shadows. Kerlikowske shot back, telling a separate congressional committee: “I would not stand by if the Border Patrol was — releasing people without going through all of the formalities.”Yet, that’s exactly what’s occurring. This report, part of an ongoing Judicial Watch investigation into the security risks along the southern border, features only a snippet of a much broader crisis in which illegal aliens are being released and vanishing into unsuspecting American communities. The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest addressed this issue just a few weeks ago in a hearing called Declining Deportations and Increasing Criminal Alien Releases – The Lawless Immigration Policies of the Obama Administration. Judd, the Border Patrol Union chief, delivered alarming figures at the hearing. He estimated that about 80% of apprehended illegal immigrants are released into the United States.Read more: Judicial Watch",fake

He was charged with lying to the Senate about Trump Tower Moscow— Jack Posobiec ✝️ (@JackPosobiec) December 27, 2018Posobiec followed up with this tweet, mocking the multiple anonymous sources used in the McClatchy story that has liberals going beserk with hope that they’ve finally got Trump on Russian collusion:McClatchy’s sourcing for their new Michael Cohen Prague article: Four people spoke with McClatchy on condition of anonymity. Each obtained their information independently from foreign intelligence connections.Conservative Treehouse was quick to point out that the same McClatchy reporters tried this same stunt only eight months ago.McClatchy journalists Peter Stone and Greg Gordon are once again attempting to prop up the most disproven allegation in the Chris Steele/Nellie Ohr dossier about Michael Cohen making a trip to Prague.  They appear to stir this false story approximately every six months.  This iteration is framed around cell-phone tower pings.Fix This Nation summarizes the April 2018 McClatchy article:One of the biggest bombshells of the week came late last Friday, courtesy of McClatchy News. According to the report, sources within the Special Counsel’s office confirmed that Robert Mueller possessed evidence that put President Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, in Prague during the summer of 2016.Why would that matter? Because, among other things, it would be the first time that the FBI or the Special Counsel has independently verified a major claim from the Steele Dossier. In other words, it would be the left’s first major “Aha, the dossier IS true” moment of this entire sordid investigation, and it would herald a new and potentially dangerous phase of the special counsel’s case against the president.According to the dossier, Cohen traveled covertly to Prague in August 2016 to meet with top Kremlin aides. The agenda: To find out how to cover the Trump campaign’s tracks vis a vis the hacking of the DNC’s networks. To put it simply, if Mueller has evidence verifying that this meeting took place – after all the denials from Cohen and other members of the Trump campaign – the house of cards begins to fall, and even Trump’s most loyal defenders will have to admit there’s something fishy in the water.But that’s a big “if.”It is probably not a coincidence that the special counsel’s office made a rare statement to the media just after the McClatchy report began making the rounds. In it, a spokesman for Robert Mueller warned the press: Don’t believe everything you hear.The special counsel has reviewed and walked away from the claim.  The Washington Post spent months trying to substantiate the claim and could find no evidence.Conservative Treehouse reports – According to WaPo reporter Greg Miller, the CIA and FBI have refuted the claim.  It simply did not happen.However, that said, the Cohen mistake within the Dossier continues to point toward how the FISA-702 FBI/NSA database was likely exploited by government intelligence ‘contractors’ to extract political opposition research.  Their FISA(16)(17) “about” queries of the database simply returned a result of the wrong Michael Cohen.Washington Post Greg Miller obliquely noted a reference to the art world when he was explaining how reporters spent months in Praque, and surrounding area, checking through hotel records and asking questions while finding no evidence.That notation to “artwork” by Greg Miller reflects a melding of the original claim with the mistaken identity of an art dealer named Michael Cohen.  It is likely Nellie Ohr, or someone with similar FISA database access, doing similar research, received the wrong result from a FISA(17) “about query” search and passed it along to Christopher Steele who included it within his dossier.  As FISC Judge Collyer noted (see above) the non-compliant, unlawful, rate for the database searches were 85%.It still seems most likely that Nellie Ohr wrote much of the dossier from the research already held by her employer Glenn Simpson at Fusion-GPS, in combination with material extracted from database searches.  Christopher Steele was used to launder the opposition research and give it the appearance -and validity- of an intelligence research document.Mrs. Nellie Ohr refused to answer questions when brought before the joint congressional committee.  She invoked ‘Spousal Privilege’.The FBI did not verify the Ohr/Steele material because they needed a legal justification for already existing surveillance on the Trump campaign.  The sketchy Ohr/Steele dossier was used to obtain sketchy FISA warrants on Trump campaign officials; making sketchy surveillance legal through the fraudulent construct of a counterintelligence operation. ",fake

He asked her if she still believes in Santa and then said, “at 7 it’s marginal, right?” You would have thought he said the worst thing you could possibly say to a young girl her age…the media was freaking out on social media so the anti-Trump crowd jumped in as well.

Lloyd, 40, (who, as it happens, shares a first name and middle initial with the president) told BuzzFeed News he would have used similar language with his daughter, and he thinks the remark is being taken out of proportion and unfairly politicized.“I think it’s crazy it became a big deal.

Really?The stock market is “tanking” because of our idiotic Federal Reserve Chairman!This raises the question of whether the feds would play politics with the market.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE FED CHAIRMAN:Since early October when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell spooked the market, the DOW has been on a downward slide.He keeps raising interest rates and then warning he’ll raise them in the future. He has singlehandedly damaged the markets with a drop like we haven’t seen in years (see today’s numbers below).The president had this to say about Powell on December, 22nd:“I totally disagree with Fed policy. I think the increase of interest rates and the shrinking of the Fed portfolio is an absolutely terrible thing to do at this time, especially in light of my major trade negotiations which are ongoing, but I never suggested firing Chairman Jay Powell, nor do I believe I have the right to do so.”According to Fox News:According to the Federal Reserve Act, the only way Trump could remove Powell or any other governor of the central bank is “for cause.” For example, if Powell broke the law that could be construed as adequate “cause” for his dismissal.So the fed chairman has more power than the president? The Fed chairman has never been fired before. He can pretty much do anything he wants to the economy except break the law.President Trump tweeted out today about his frustration with Powell.  He’s ready to do anything to yank Powell out of his position as Fed Chairman because he’s killing off the gains in the market:The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch – he can’t putt!The only problem our economy has is the Fed.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2018HERE’S A LOOK AT TODAY’S DROP IN THE MARKET:IS THE FED CHAIRMAN PLAYING POLITICS WITH OUR MARKET?Fed Chairman Jerome Powell just screwed America and President Trump by raising the interest rate AGAIN.This is the 8th time in just over 3 years that the Fed has raised rates.In June of this year, the New York Times published a report about the 7 times rates have been raised in 3 years:“Why The Feds Raised The Rates for the Seventh Time in Three Years”Just to compare, Obama had rates raised only once during his 8 years as president! Only once!The DOW WAS UP 364 AND THEN DROPPED over 300 points after the announcement of the interest rate hike!Americans have lost over $4 trillion since the Fed has been raising rates.TRUMP’S ECONOMIC ADVISOR SUGGESTS FIRING THE FED FOR “ECONOMIC MALPRACTICE”Stephen Moore is one of President Trump’s economic advisors and is clued into the Trump policy of a pro-growth economy. He’s aware that raising interest rates repeatedly just crashes the market so he just gave a warning to the fed:The Fed has been way too tight. They made a major blunder three months ago with raising the rates. It’s caused a deflation in commodity prices. And I will say this, David, if the Fed raises interest rates tomorrow they should all be fired for economic malpractice.Carol Roth counters that rates will be raised. This means that if Jerome Powell raises rates, it will be the 8th time in President trump’s presidency that rates have been raised. Compare that to the one time rates were raised in all 8 years of Obama’s presidency.The big questions everyone’s asking is whether Powell is playing politics with our money. It sure would seem like it.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE FED:PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED OUT THE FED CHAIRMAN:President Trump just called out the Fed chairman for his threat to raise interest rates again. Just to compare, Obama’s fed chair raised interest rates once but Trump’s has raised it 7 times. SEVEN TIMES!Is Chairman Powell playing politics?
Early in October, the DOW was at an all-time high when Powell threatened to raise rates again scaring away investors.Check out our previous report where Fox News’ Charles Payne calls out the Fed chairman for raising rates so many times:It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike.

331,24-Dec-18,"Can you believe it? How petty can they be?TWO DEMOCRATS have decided to challenge one of President Trump’s judicial nominees because he’s a member of the Knights of Columbus.The Catholic organization called Knights of Columbus is as harmless as they come but the two Senators claim the judicial nominee wouldn’t be fair and impartial because of his affiliation with the Roman Catholic charitable organization.Via Fox News:Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, raised concerns about Omaha-based lawyer Brian Buescher’s membership as part of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s review of his nomination by President Trump to sit on the U.S. District Court in Nebraska, as first reported by the Catholic News Agency.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Hirono cited the position of Knights of Columbus on same-sex marriage as an example of the inability of the judge to be impartial.This is just about as nitpicky as you can get when it comes to judicial nominees. Think about all of the judges who came before Buescher who were members of some sort of organization but were able to decide a case on the merits and not on any personal bias. It’s what judges are supposed to do!Buescher argued his case:“The Knights of Columbus does not have the authority to take personal political positions on behalf of all of its approximately two million members. If confirmed, I will apply all provisions of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges regarding recusal and disqualification.”Harris, in her questions to the nominee, called the Knights of Columbus “an all-male society” and asked the Nebraska lawyer if he was aware that the group was anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage when he joined. The California senator also referenced Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson’s statement that abortion amounted to “the killing of the innocent on a massive scale” and asked Buescher if he agreed with the statement.Buescher responded that his involvement in the group consisted mostly of charitable work and community events at his local Catholic parish. He indicated he would abide by judicial precedent regarding abortion.",fake
332,24-Dec-18,"The next time a friend or family member attempts to explain to you about the benefits cheap labor in the United States, you might want to refer to this handy-dandy document, provided by The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). The comprehensive and easy to understand “Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on the American Taxpayer for 2017” document explains the extreme burden American taxpayers are saddled with, so employers can hire cheap labor, which in many cases, undercuts the ability for low-income Americans and students to compete for jobs.Democrat lawmakers and businesses who benefit from low labor costs have been trying to convince Americans of the benefits of laxed security on our southern borders. In addition to allowing criminals to cross our borders with no background checks, there’s the massive financial burden on American workers that no one is talking about—except for organizations like FAIR, who are sounding the alarm bells over the cost of our broken immigration system.From FAIR‘s The Fiscal Burden Of Illegal Immigration on The American Taxpayer -2017:Even in the absence of any complex studies, basic mathematics make it self-evident that illegal aliens are a drain on the U.S. economy. For example, in its report The Sinking Lifeboat: Uncontrolled Immigration and the U.S. Health Care System in 2009, FAIR found that, in some hospitals, as many as two-thirds of total operating costs are attributable to uncompensated care for illegal aliens. If those costs are being borne by American taxpayers, rather than the illegal aliens who received medical treatment, then those illegal aliens are consuming more services than they pay for, and the costs of providing those services are never recouped. That makes them a net drain on the economy.A careful examination of the federal budget shows an annual outlay of approximately $46 billion for expenses related to illegal immigration. A review of state budgets indicates even greater local costs, estimated at $89 billion annually. This means that the overall costs attributable to illegal aliens totals an annual bill of $135 billion. That equates to over $8,000 per illegal alien and dependent, per year.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Some illegal aliens do pay certain taxes. However, employers usually hire illegal aliens to obtain cheap labor at wages well below the market rate for a given area. Many of those employers pay illegal aliens “under-the-table” and do not deduct payroll taxes. Due to their lack of immigration status, illegal aliens are unlikely to report their income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Therefore, state and local governments, as well as the federal government, are not collecting enough taxes from illegal aliens to cover the costs of the services they consume. We estimate that illegal aliens actually pay just under $19 billion in combined state, local, and federal taxes. That means that the United States recoups only about 14 percent of the amount expended annually on illegal aliens. If the same jobs held by illegal aliens were filled by legal workers, at the prevailing market wage, it may safely be presumed that federal, state and local governments would receive higher tax payments.FAIR firmly believes that the costs of illegal immigration (and massive legal immigration) significantly outweigh any perceived benefit. Accordingly, this study focuses only on calculating the overall costs of illegal immigration.Estimating the fiscal burden of illegal immigration on the U.S. taxpayer depends on the size and characteristics of the illegal alien population. FAIR defines “illegal alien” as anyone who entered the United States without authorization and anyone who unlawfully remains once his/her authorization has expired.It is challenging to determine how many illegal aliens are present in the United States at any given time. The Department of Homeland Security only counts those foreigners who enter and leave the country through lawful channels. Those who deliberately evade immigration authorities and sneak across the border remain uncounted.Once in the United States, most illegal aliens live in the shadows and interact with the government only on a very limited basis. Others commit ongoing immigration and identity fraud, claiming to be either green card holders or U.S. citizens. As a result, the U.S. government typically becomes aware of illegal aliens when they are encountered by state and local, or federal, law enforcement agencies. Unfortunately, the U.S. government has no central database containing information on the citizenship status of everyone lawfully present in the United States. Therefore it is often difficult for police, prison officials, and other enforcement entities to determine whether an individual they encounter is actually lawfully present in the United States, or whether that individual is falsely claiming to be here legally.Here are just a few examples that FAIR has provided in their federal expenditures study:After rising rapidly since the 1980s, births to illegal alien mothers dropped during the great recession (2008-2010). Since then, the numbers appear to have held relatively steady. Pew Research estimated that by the end of 2013, illegal alien mothers gave birth to approximately 275,000 children in the United States. In 2015 (the most recent year for which statistics are available), foreign-born mothers accounted for a disproportionate share of a nationwide total of about 3.98 million births: 872,256 or 22 percent of the total.Medicaid paid for 45 percent of all births in 2010. 21 Presuming that Medicaid also paid for 45 percent of all births in 2015, it covered the costs for about 392,000 births to foreign-born mothers. The cost of those births is shared between the federal taxpayer and the state taxpayer. The total cost depends on the type of delivery and whether complications occur.Colloquially referred to as “Food Stamps,” the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
is also administered by USDA-FNS. Illegal aliens are ineligible for SNAP but their U.S.-born children
are eligible. (In certain limited circumstances, elderly and disabled citizens residing with illegal alien relatives may qualify for SNAP benefits but they account for only a very small percentage of SNAP use by illegal alien households.)The eligibility requirements for SNAP are based on household income. However, income earned by illegal alien parents is not used to calculate whether their U.S. citizen children qualify for the program. Accordingly, virtually all citizen children of illegal aliens qualify for SNAP.The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, commonly known as “WIC,” provides Federal grants to States for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income, pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk.Eligibility for WIC is established by income. Currently, those earning 185 percent of the federal poverty level, or lower, are eligible to apply for this benefit. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, WIC served 53 percent of all infants born in the United States in 2013. WIC is available to anyone who is in the United States and falls within a WIC eligible category (i.e., pregnant, postpartum, breastfeeding, infants under one year of age, and children under five years of age), is a full-time resident of the state where he/she is applying for WIC, meets the income requirements, and is at risk for malnutrition. As a federally funded, state-administered program, each state is entitled to determine whether it will allow illegal aliens to draw WIC benefits. All fifty states have extended eligibility to illegal aliens.A study by the Center for Immigration (CIS) studies found that approximately 35.1 percent of illegal alien households with children use the WIC program.53 Using a baseline of 4.0 million illegal alien households, this would indicate that approximately 1.4 million illegal alien households draw benefits under the WICThe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program is the current successor to the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. TANF was created to help needy families achieve self-sufficiency by providing temporary cash assistance to supplement their earned income.In order to qualify, applicants must be either pregnant or responsible for a child under 19 years of age, meet income requirements, and be underemployed, about to become unemployed, or about to become unemployed. Recipients must be working or actively seeking employment; and, generally speaking, adults with dependent children receiving TANF must continue to meet financial and technical eligibility requirements.Like SNAP, TANF is a welfare program that is not available to illegal aliens. However, illegal alien families that have U.S.-born children may still obtain significant financial assistance via this program. Certain TANF benefits are available to the U.S. citizen children of illegal aliens who are being cared for by grandparents, foster parents, aunts, and uncles. These are referred to as “child-only” applications.ICE is responsible for enforcing both civil and criminal immigration laws within the interior of the United States. Non-ERO ICE operations primarily involve detecting, arresting, and prosecuting lawfully present aliens who engage in criminal acts that violate the terms of their admission to the United States, as well as detecting, detaining, and criminally prosecuting illegal aliens involved in people smuggling, human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun running. ICE is also responsible for enforcement of U.S. customs laws within the interior of the United States. As such, it handles some of the impost collection, licensing and enforcement duties that were handled by the U.S. Customs Service prior to the formation of DHS.The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) provides federal payments to states and localities that incurred correctional officer salary costs for incarcerating criminal illegal aliens who have at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions for violations of state or local law, and who are incarcerated for at least 4 consecutive days during the reporting period. In the fiscal year 2016, Congress appropriated $210 million to fund the SCAAP program.The illegal alien population consists of both those aliens who entered the United States without authorization and those who entered the United States lawfully but overstayed their authorized period of stay. Illegal aliens are subject to removal from the United States simply because they are present in the United States without authorization. However, many illegal aliens come to the attention of DHS when they are arrested for the commission of a crime.Legal aliens are also subject to deportation if convicted of certain crimes. Generally speaking, legal aliens tend to offend at a lower rate than illegal aliens. This is unsurprising since a significant percentage of illegal aliens cross the border without authorization specifically for the purpose of engaging in criminal costs associated with illegal immigration, this study can be assumed to underestimate the fiscal burden imposed on the U.S. taxpayer.All calculations are based on the most recent data available. The majority of the data is drawn from sources covering the 2014, 2015, and 2016 fiscal years. Most of these statistics reflect the fiscal impact of immigration policies pursued by the Obama administration during its final years in office. Future studies should allow for a comparative examination of the economic effects of President Trump’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement versus President Obama’s “alien rights first” approach.To read the entire report, go HERE.",fake

She’s also alleged to have deceived banks about the relationship between Huawei and the subsidiary, Skycom.None of the allegations have been proven in court, and while the U.S. issued an arrest warrant, no charges have been laid.China has threatened Canada with “grave consequences” if Meng is not released, calling her detention “unreasonable, unconscionable and vile in nature.”The Huawei CFO is the daughter of Ren Zhengfei, Huawei founder, who, according to Forbes Magazine, is reportedly worth $3.2 billion. Her grandfather was also a close friend of Chairman Mao Zedong, who is considered by many to be the greatest mass murderer in the history of the world.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]New York Post reports – Furious Chinese Communists have begun arresting innocent Canadians in retaliation. So far, three of these “revenge hostages” have been taken and are being held in secret jails on vague charges. Beijing hints that the hostage count may grow if Meng is not freed and fast.CTV News reports that relations between Canada and China are disintegrating after former Canadian diplomat, Michael Kovrig has been detained. A spokesperson says they are doing everything possible to discover his whereabouts and negotiate his release. Amid growing tensions over the arrest of Megn Wanzhou, Canada is considering a travel advisory to China over concern for the imprisonment of its citizens by the Chinese government.Even for a thuggish regime like China’s, this kind of action is almost unprecedented.So who is Meng Wanzhou?Currently under house arrest and awaiting extradition to the US, she will face charges that her company violated US sanctions by doing business with Iran and committed bank fraud by disguising the payments it received in return.But to say that she is the CFO of Huawei doesn’t begin to explain her importance — or China’s reaction.It turns out that “Princess” Meng, as she is called, is Communist royalty. Her grandfather was a close comrade of Chairman Mao during the Chinese Civil War, who went on to become vice governor of China’s largest province.She is also the daughter of Huawei’s Founder and Chairman, Ren Zhengfei. Daddy is grooming her to succeed him when he retires.In other words, Meng is the heiress apparent of China’s largest and most advanced hi-tech company, and one which plays a key role in China’s grand strategy of global domination.Huawei is a leader in 5G technology and, earlier this year, surpassed Apple to become the second largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung.But Huawei is much more than an innocent manufacturer of smartphones.It is a spy agency of the Chinese Communist Party.How do we know?Because the party has repeatedly said so.First in 2015 and then again in June 2017, the party declared that all Chinese companies must collaborate in gathering intelligence.“All organizations and citizens,” reads Article 7 of China’s National Intelligence Law, “must support, assist with, and collaborate in national intelligence work, and guard the national intelligence work secrets they are privy to.”All Chinese companies, whether they are private or owned by the state, are now part and parcel of the party’s massive overseas espionage campaign.Huawei is a key part of this aggressive effort to spy on the rest of the world. The company’s smartphones, according to FBI Director Christopher Wray, can be used to “maliciously modify or steal information,” as well as “conduct undetected espionage.” Earlier this year the Pentagon banned the devices from all US military bases worldwide.But Huawei, which has been specially designated as a “national champion,” has an even more important assignment from the Communist Party than simply listening in on phone conversations.As a global leader in 5G technology, it has been tasked with installing 5G “fiber to the phone” networks in countries around the world.In fact, “Made in China 2025” — the party’s aggressive plan to dominate the cutting-edge technologies of the 21st century — singles out Huawei as the key to achieving global 5G dominance.Any network system installed by a company working hand-in-glove with China’s intelligence services raises the danger of not only cyber espionage, but also cyber-enabled technology theft.And the danger doesn’t stop there.The new superfast 5G networks, which are 100 times faster than 4G, will literally run the world of the future. Everything from smartphones to smart cities, from self-driving vehicles to, yes, even weapons systems, will be under their control.In other words, whoever controls the 5G networks will control the world — or at least large parts of it.Huawei has reportedly secured more than 25 commercial contracts for 5G, but has been locked out of an increasing number of countries around the world because of spying concerns.The “Five Eyes” — Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the US — have over the past year waged a concerted campaign to block the Chinese tech giant from dominating next-generation wireless networks around the world. Not only have they largely kept Huawei out of their own countries, they have convinced other countries like Japan, India and Germany to go along, too.For entire story –New York Post.",fake

339,22-Dec-18,"Newly elected Somali-Muslim Congresswoman Ilhan Omar appeared on the Dean Obeidallah radio show to discuss President Trump’s border wall.Meanwhile, in reality, criminals and terrorists are illegally crossing our borders on a regular basis. Bob Price of Breitbart News is reported only yesterday, that Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents stopped three sex offenders from successfully re-entering the U.S. after they illegally crossed the border into Texas. Two of the criminal aliens had convictions for sexual offenses against children — the third for sexual battery.During her interview, the woman who is accused of marrying her own brother so he could game the system in America shared her thoughts on the construction of a wall on our southern border that will help to keep America safe from criminals like the three illegal aliens with criminal records of sexual assault that were caught only yesterday.Last month, in what was an expected election result, Democrats in Minnesota elected Somali refugee, Ilhan Omar to be their next Muslim US Congresswoman. In January, Omar will fill the seat of the disgraced outgoing Muslim Congressman, Keith Ellison, who was recently forced to resign as the DNC vice chair, after multiple credible accusations of domestic violence. The Somali-born Muslim lawmaker, Ilhan Omar, brings her own set of baggage with her to Washington DC, including multiple campaign finance violation charges as well as a controversy surrounding allegations that she committed immigration fraud when she married and then divorced her own brother.Omar has also received special treatment from our media, who have completely ignored a hateful tweet against Jews that was posted by Omar while she was a state lawmaker in Minnesota. In her tweet, Omar asked Allah to awaken the people to help them see the evil doings of Israel.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. #Gaza #Palestine #IsraelIt would appear that Omar’s disdain for other religions isn’t limited to Jews. Last week, the Muslim lawmaker mocked Jesus and Mike Pence in one nasty tweet, while defending her stance on open borders in the U.S.Omar tweeted a photo with Vice President, Mike Pence, who appears to be praying, mocking him with the phrase, “Jesus take the wheel!”, followed by #BorderWallJesus take the wheel! #BorderWallJesus take the wheel! #BorderWall pic.twitter.com/aEPle6HFF1— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) December 11, 2018Now, Omar is speaking out about America’s “xenophobic” wall and attempting to convince listeners on the Dean Obeidallah radio show that “documented and undocumented immigrants are much safer than those who are American born.”  Hmmm…where did she pull those statistics from—CAIR?Listen to the unbelievable interview here:Pro-Sharia Somali-born Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar claims a border wall is:""Deeply rooted in Xenophobia"" & agrees it's ""A Monument to White-Supremacists""Why is an anti-Semitic terror-tied radical who allegedly engaged in marriage & immigration fraud allowed to serve in Congress!? pic.twitter.com/ohg670RiiS— Amy Mek (@AmyMek) December 22, 2018In 2016, Ilhan Ilhan Omar’s website attributed her win to immigrant Somalis: “More than 250 volunteers and 450 individual donors supported Ilhan’s campaign. ‘I am so proud that the majority of contributions to my campaign are from members of the Somali community who believe in my leadership,’” the site said. Somalis in other states supported her, including Washington state and Ohio.Here’s a stunning 2010 investigative report on Muslim terrorists from the Middle East, who are crossing our southern border and threatening the safety and security of American citizens. Does anyone foolishly believe that these Islamic terrorists have stopped flooding into our country?In 2016, two Minnesota journalists — Scott Johnson of Powerline and Preya Samsundar of AlphaNewsMN — researched an anonymous tip about Ilhan Omar. The tipster had presented evidence that Omar married her brother in 2009, and was still legally his wife as of 2016. The tipster had also asserted that Omar may have done it to help her brother commit immigration fraud. Further, the tipster had noted that Omar has been “culturally” married to, and living with, a second man since 2002 — the father of her three children.Simple online searches of public civil records and social media immediately proved parts of the story to be true.Samsundar discovered additional compelling evidence and even managed to get in touch with the apparent husband/brother, who currently lives in London. He proceeded to talk himself into a pickle trying to answer Samsundar’s questions.For doing their jobs admirably, Johnson and Samsundar were subsequently labeled “Islamophobes” and bigots. Omar’s own representatives lashed out with such comments.The Minneapolis Star-Tribune and “alternative weekly” City Pages — though they certainly “followed up” on the story — offered minimal effort beyond publishing official comments from Omar’s campaign. After first blaming anti-Muslim bigotry, Omar changed tactics by offering an eyebrow-raising statement that left specific evidence and accusations unaddressed.It worked. Virtually all media outlets that covered the allegations seemed content with Omar’s official statement. She was soon sworn in — the first Muslim Somali to be elected to a U.S. state legislature. That achievement landed her the cover of Time.PJ Media reports – In addition to the allegation that Omar appears to have married her brother, newly uncovered evidence, Omar is now facing another allegation: Ilhan Omar has since signed off on apparent falsehoods, under penalty of perjury, during her 2017 divorce from the man in question: Ahmed Nur Said Elmi.On Wednesday morning, Alpha News received an anonymous tip of it’s own.An individual who identified themselves as part of the Somali Community pointed Alpha News towards a Secretary of State Office filing for One to One Cafe’ Lounge.Ahmed A. Hirsi filed with the State to open a cafe named One to One Cafe’ Lounge in May of 2009. The address listed by Ahmed A. Hirsi in the official document is 859 41st Ave NE in Columbia Heights.You can see in the marriage license application obtained by Alpha News the “859 41st Ave NE” address is the same one Ilhan Omar and Ahmed Nur Said Elmi used on their marriage license just three months earlier.Both Omar and Elmi declare that their place of residence after marriage would be the same address in Columbia Heights, MN.These filings suggest that Hirsi, Elmi and Omar were all living at the same Columbia Heights home from the time of Omar and Elmi’s marriage in February 2009.Our anonymous source tells Alpha News that Ahmed Hirsi is Ilhan Omar’s cultural husband. The source said, “The two have been married Islamically and at no time were they separated.” – Alpha News MNNew Evidence, New AllegationsMinnesota law deems court records of divorce proceedings to be available to the public. In 2017, several months after Omar’s marriage history briefly created a national news item, Omar quietly petitioned family court for a default divorce, claiming she could not locate Elmi.The above document depicts Omar, under penalty of perjury, attesting to the court that she has not had contact with her legal husband since June 2011.To those familiar with the 2016 coverage of this story, this claim should strike as a jaw-dropper.To reference just one example, the three immediately following photos were pivotal elements of the 2016 coverage. These pictures first appeared on Ilhan Omar’s personal Instagram account in 2014 (her username at the time was “hameey”), and depict Ilhan visiting Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in London that year.On June 12, 2012, Elmi’s Instagram account reveals a picture of himself with a baby, who was, according to PJ Media, born the day before to his legal wife.The caption on his Instagram account reads: “Nieces, fresh out of the vagina!”Wow!Ilhan Omar attested in court that she has had zero contact with Ahmed Elmi since before Ilwad was conceived, let alone born.The silver lining for Elmi here is that he still likely has little reason to fear a process server greeting him in London with a paternity test.Because he clearly calls his wife’s child … a niece?Here’s another video of Congressman Duncan Hunter (R-CA) telling former Fox News host Greta VanSusteren about how US Border agents apprehended members of ISIS who were attempting to cross our southern border.Are you feeling safer yet? Do you fear the policies newly elected Democrats like Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) are going to fight to implement that will weaken our nation’s security?There has never been a better time for Americans to stand up and demand that Trump’s wall is funded.What are your thoughts?

The openly anti-Trump Justice was hospitalized only one day after the 2018 midterm elections, after reportedly taking a nasty fall in her home on Wednesday evening. Many have been waiting for the retirement of Justice Ginsburg, who was highly critical of  Donald Trump while he was a candidate for President, and who was a huge fan of Barack Obama’s.Mike Valerio of WUSA9 tweeted a statement that was released by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding Ginsburg’s surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.The statement that was released today read:Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent a pulmonary lobectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Two nodules in the lower lobe of her left lung were discovered incidentally during tests performed at George Washington University Hospital to diagnose and treat rib fractures sustained in a fall on November 7. According to the thoracic surgeon, Valeria W. Rusch, MD, FACS, both nodules removed during surgery were found to be malignant on initial pathology evaluation. Post-surgery, there was no evidence of any remaining disease. Scans performed before surgery indicated no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body. Currently, no further treatment is planned. Justice Ginsburg is resting comfortably and is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days. Updates will be provided as they become available. #RGB#BREAKING: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent surgery today for early stage lung cancer, according to the Supreme Court public information officer.• The 85-year-old is at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York.• NO traces of disease found after surgery@WUSA9 pic.twitter.com/6PM2z2qzQs— Mike Valerio (@MikevWUSA) December 21, 2018Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly tweeted that Ginsburg is “very ill.” O’Reilly predicts, “Another Justice appointment inevitable and soon.

Bad news for the left.— Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) December 21, 2018Lung cancer begins in the lungs with abnormal cells which cluster to form a tumor. These cancer cells grow without any control or order, destroying the healthy lung tissue around them.The reason lung cancer causes so much concern is that it often spreads to lymph nodes or other organs in the body, such as the brain. If the cancer cells grow too quickly, they can prevent organs in the body from working properly. Cancer that begins in other parts of the body may spread to the lungs, but this is not the same as lung cancer.A cancerous lung nodule often should be removed with surgery, and if no other cancer is found, it may require no other treatment. When caught early, malignant lung nodules are often successfully treated.While Donald Trump was running for President, Ginsburg trashed his character, saying, “He is a faker. He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. … How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.”During a New York Times interview, Ginsburg warned about a Trump presidency: “I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president.”On July 12, 2016, President Trump responded to Ginsburg’s criticism of him, calling on her to resign:Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

345,19-Dec-18,"A court filing that was part of the final report in the Buzzfeed defamation lawsuit proves without a doubt just what we’ve been reporting (see below) about the Steele dossier and who handed it over to Buzzfeed.A longtime associate of the late Senator John McCain gave the fake “Golden Showers” Steele dossier to a BuzzFeed News reporter.We’ve previously reported that David Kramer is a former State Department official who was an executive at the McCain Institute. He was sent out by McCain to destroy candidate Trump and then he refused to respond to questions about doing so. He’s part of the Deep State Swamp Creature Party.On Dec. 29, 2016, BuzzFeed reporter Ken Bensinger met with David Kramer according to documents filed today.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Buzzfeed then published the dossier in early January of 2017 after it was handed over by Kramer.The funny business begins between Ken Bensinger of Buzzfeed and David Kramer of the McCain Institute:“The parties dispute whether Kramer gave Bensinger a copy or whether Bensinger took photos of the Dossier when Kramer was not looking,”This is why the entire dossier is a set up against Trump:CLINTON HIRES STEELE AND SIMPSON ALL IN CAHOOTS!Daily Caller reports:Kramer obtained copies of the dossier after meeting in late November 2016 with Steele. He and McCain became aware of Steele’s investigation of then-candidate Donald Trump earlier that month at the Halifax International Security Forum.McCain dispatched Kramer to London to meet with Steele. After that Nov. 28, 2016 encounter, Kramer obtained a copy of the dossier from Glenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS, the firm that hired Steele on behalf of the Clinton campaign and DNC.Kramer met Nov. 30, 2016, with McCain and McCain’s chief of staff, Christopher Brose, to review Steele’s reports.“Kramer advised McCain to share the reports with the FBI and the CIA,” according to Ungaro.Days later, Kramer met at McCain’s behest with Victoria Nuland, who served then as assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasian affairs and the State Department, and Celeste Wallender, the top Russian affairs official at the National Security Council.So Senator John McCain’s lackey gets the FAKE dossier and then it’s given to Buzzfeed to publish…It’s all downhill from there because it opens the door for the FISA requests. If this was a Democrat in office, these people would have been shut down so fast. It’s because this is a president that the Deep State doesn’t like that this continues on and on and on.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE MCCAIN ASSOCIATE WHO REFUSED TO SPILL THE BEANS:Lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed for publishing the Steele dossier say that a longtime associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain and two major news outlets are resisting subpoenas seeking their depositions for the case.In a brief filed in federal court late Wednesday, lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, claim that David Kramer (pictured below), a former State Department official and McCain associate, “has been seemingly avoiding service” of a deposition subpoena for weeks.Please see the very curious input Reason.com put out just this July regarding Kramer’s involvement in the Steele dossier getting into the hands of the press.And The New York Times and Wall Street Journal are challenging deposition subpoenas they have been served as part of the case.Gubarev’s lawyers are attempting to find out who gave BuzzFeed the salacious dossier, which the website published to much controversy on Jan. 10.The dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleges that Gubarev and his companies, XBT Holdings and Webzilla, used spam, viruses and porn bots to hack into DNC computer systems. Gubarev vehemently denies the allegations.Gubarev’s attorneys say that identifying BuzzFeed’s source could shed light on whether the news outlet was warned that information in the dossier could be false. They argue that publishing the dossier despite such warnings would show “reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information published.”BuzzFeed has defended its decision to publish the dossier, which was financed by the Clinton campaign and DNC and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. It is also resisting demands from Gubarev’s team to identify its dossier source on the grounds that it would violate its First Amendment protections as a news-gathering organization.Via: Daily CallerReason had this to say on July 16th on the mystery surrounding how the fake dossier got into the hands of Buzzfeed:Did John McCain and a controversial D.C. lobbying group conspire to get the infamous “pee dossier” into the hands of the press?A lawsuit making its way through court in the UK hopes to determine just what role the senator and his associates had in making the lurid dossier public.New filings in the lawsuit, obtained by McClatchy, detail how David Kramer—employed by the nonprofit and purportedly non-political McCain Institute—acted as a representative of McCain in the Arizona senator’s dealings on sensitive intelligence measures:According to a new court document in the British lawsuit, counsel for defendants Steele and Orbis repeatedly point to McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal Trump critic, and a former State Department official as two in a handful of people known to have had copies of the full document before it circulated among journalists and was published by BuzzFeed.

So how did they get from there to publication in Buzzfeed?",fake

McCallum spoke with George Washington University constitutional law professor, Jonathan Turley, to discuss the conditions under which Michael Flynn was investigated.Today, near the end of a lengthy interview, where Fox News’ Chris Wallace made several failed “gotcha” attempts with President Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, he asked Giuliani if there was any possiblity Trump would sit down for an interview with Robert Mueller? Giuliani laughed, telling him, “Good Luck” and that he would agree to Trump sitting down with special counsel Robert Mueller over his “dead body.” When Giulini was asked by Wallace if President Trump thinks General Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence and to the FBI, Rudy told Wallace he believes Trump’s ex-national security advisor was “railroaded” and even “framed.”Watch:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Fox News– In the spirited back-and-forth with host Chris Wallace, Giuliani also reiterated his claim that Trump initially “didn’t know about” the hush-money payments made to two women by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen that prosecutors have alleged constituted campaign finance violations.Giuliani said Trump eventually found out about the payments and reimbursed Cohen, adding that Cohen is a “complete, pathological liar” who defied basic principles of ethics by secretly tape-recording his own client for several hours.“Yes, this man is lying — is that a surprise to you, that Michael Cohen is lying?” Giuliani asked. “The man got up in front of a judge and said, ‘I was fiercely loyal to Donald Trump.’ Nonsense. He wasn’t fiercely loyal to him, he taped him. He sat there with [CNN anchor] Chris Cuomo, told him he wasn’t being taped, showed him a drawer and he lied to him and taped him for two hours.” ",fake
357,16-Dec-18,"Last month, in what was an expected election result, Democrats in Minnesota elected Ilhan Omar to be their next Muslim US Congresswoman. Omar will soon fill the seat of the disgraced outgoing Muslim Congressman, Keith Ellison, who was recently forced to resign as the DNC vice chair, after multiple credible accusations of domestic violence. The Somali-born Muslim lawmaker, Ilhan Omar, brings her own set of baggage with her to Washington DC, including multiple campaign finance violation charges as well as a controversy surrounding allegations that she committed immigration fraud when she married and then divorced her own brother.Omar has also received special treatment from our media, who have completely ignored a hateful tweet against Jews that was posted by Omar while she was a state lawmaker in Minnesota. In her tweet, Omar asked Allah to awaken the people to help them see the evil doings of Israel.Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. #Gaza #Palestine #IsraelAccording to Vox – East African immigrant workers in Minneapolis are rallying for fair treatment.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Khadra Ibrahin, a 28-year-old single mother of two and Somali immigrant living in Minneapolis, has been working at Amazon’s Shakopee fulfillment center for two years.As a practicing Muslim, Ibrahin tries to pray five times a day. But because Amazon has the warehouse associates working on a strict hourly packing quota, she says she cannot take a prayer break. Associates are pressured to “make rate,” with the rate number increasing and decreasing depending on the season’s demand. Shakopee’s current packing rate is 240 boxes an hour, Ibrahin says, but it’s gone as high as 400. Associates are penalized if they fall behind this rate; they can get a write-up from a manager if they are too slow, which can lead to them being terminated.Ibrahin usually chooses to pray during her timed breaks. “Breaks make our rate slow down, and then we’d be at risk of getting fired, and so most of the time we choose prayer over bathroom, and have learned to balance our bodily needs,” she told me in a recent phone interview.Ilhan Omar said in an email that she feels it’s important for Amazon to fully “take into consideration the particular needs and practices of this community.”“Amazon has shown a willingness to invest in American communities and build up in areas where their businesses are located,” Omar says. “We want to see the company make that same investment in American workers and make sure profits and benefits are being adequately and equitably distributed to their own workers. There is no better time to deliver this message than right now — during a month when the holiday season is increasing not only Amazon’s profitability, but also the pressure on their workers, and time they are asked to spend away from their families.”In response to the meeting, Amazon made changes that mainly dealt with issues around practicing Islam. Muslim Amazon workers had no place to pray in the warehouse, and they complained about not being able to keep up with the job during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan when they fast until sundown. Amazon responded by creating a dedicated prayer space, and said it has been working to make shifts more manageable during Ramadan. But Muse says these moves are like Band-Aids that address small issues without tackling the larger problems.In a statement to Vox, Amazon said:We work hard every day to ensure all of our employees are treated fairly and with dignity and respect, including here in Minnesota where we have an open and direct dialogue with employees. Amazon offers a great employment opportunity with excellent pay – ranging here from $16.25-$20.80 an hour, and comprehensive benefits including health care, up to 20 weeks parental leave, paid education, promotional opportunities, and more. [We] encourage anyone to compare our pay, benefits, and workplace to other retailers and major employers in the Shakopee community and across the country. We invite anyone to see for themselves and take a tour through our fulfillment center tour program.Regarding its prayer breaks, Amazon told me that “prayer breaks less than 20 minutes are paid, and productivity expectations are not adjusted for such breaks. Associates are welcome to request an unpaid prayer break for over 20 minutes for which productivity expectations would be adjusted.”Ibrahin also says that until recently, nearly all Amazon managers at the Shakopee warehouse were white, which contributed to the culture gap many African workers perceive in the facility. Amazon recently brought in a Muslim manager for the warehouse from Austin who is from Libya. Muse says the hire is upsetting to existing workers because “there is plenty of talent [at the local warehouse], which is clearly not being recognized for managers.”",fake
358,16-Dec-18,"We reported yesterday that the father of the 7-year old who died at the border said the border patrol did everything they could to save his daughter. That was before he lawyered up.The father has hired two lawyers and now claims he gave his daughter water and food on the bus ride (bus ride?) from Guatemala to Mexico. The border patrol has reported the young girl hadn’t eaten or had any fluids in days.Looks like someone is trying to get more than a simple explanation on the cause of death. The father is staying with activists at the border who have now gotten involved in the case.

359,16-Dec-18,"According to SFGate– The Minneapolis City Council voted last Friday to eliminate single-family zoning, and instead, allow residential structures with up to three dwelling units — like duplexes and triplexes — in every neighborhood. Minneapolis is believed to be the first major city in the United States to approve such a change citywide.The decision came as part of a sweeping plan to propel the city into the future by addressing issues like housing, racial equity, and climate change. The plan, called Minneapolis 2040, drew thousands of public comments, “Don’t Bulldoze Our Neighborhoods” yard signs and a last-minute lawsuit, but ultimately passed on a 12-1 vote.It will now go to a regional planning agency for review. City officials expect the zoning changes to go into effect sometime next year.The Minneapolis City Council is made up of 12 Democrats and one Green Party member — success there could offer one model of what is possible.Is the Minneapolis City Council struggling to fix racial inequality and climate change, or are they attempting to fix a lack of housing for the exploding Somali population who tend pack multiple families into one single family home or apartment?Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been dubbed the Somali capitol of the United States, boasting a Somali population of 60,000 persons.Jeffrey Dishinger wrote about the need for more housing options for the exploding Somali immigrant population in Minneapolis, citing the increasing number of Somali immigrants in Minnesota and the demand for affordable housing that increases since many of the Somali families in Minneapolis make so little money. In his research, Dishinger discusses the difficulties Somali immigrants face in finding housing, as the size of their families tends to be larger, and how it’s uncommon for extended family members to all be living together in one home or apartment. He also warns about the supply of available housing not being able to meet the demand for housing for the massive immigrant population.A female resident of the neighborhood, obviously shaken in a TV interview, related how she was screamed at by a Somali man who threatened to kidnap and rape her.“They were screaming at the house that they were going to kidnap you and they were going to rape you,” one Minneapolis resident told KSTP TV. “It was a very traumatizing experience.”Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims, and residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this isn’t the first time a group of Somali men has made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.Watch:Ami Horowitz, a thought-provoking filmmaker took to the streets in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, MN to talk a variety of Somali Muslim immigrants and get their thoughts on America and how they view Americans who don’t hold their same religious views.Ami posed several questions to a large variety of random Somali Muslim immigrants. He asked young boys, teenagers, middle-aged men, and even an older woman their thoughts on how they felt about living in the United States, and if they’d rather live back in Somalia. Horowitz also asked if they would prefer to live under Sharia Law or American laws. Their answers may surprise you.The most shocking part of the video, however, comes near the end when Horowitz begins to discuss freedom of speech in America. While one of the men being interviewed talks about how great it is to be in America and to be afforded rights like freedom of speech and freedom of religion, every single Muslim respondent believed that free speech is great unless it involves criticizing the prophet, Mohammed. Horowitz took his question a step further and asked if was okay for Muslims to use violence against someone who disparaged or insulted Mohammed. Every Muslim he asked, believed that using violence, including killing a person who criticized or mocked Mohammed, would be justified.Watch:Muslim US Congresswoman-elect, Ihlan Omar (D), is a Somali immigrant who was elected to replace the former Muslim Congressman Keith Ellison (D-MN). Only six months ago, the disgraced former DNC Deputy Chair Keith Ellison, spoke at the Minnesota DFL convention, where mocked the idea of having work requirements for those that receive welfare benefits. This is the same guy who thinks it’s a great idea to give people a “basic income” no matter what they do so they can “do other things”.Watch:Is Minneapolis lost?

The trees were made out of fake cranberries and are beautiful but the left has to be critical of all things Trump.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON ONE VOLUNTEER WHO WAS SHOCKED AT THE “HORRIBLE” COMMENTS ABOUT THE RED TREES:Here’s proof that the left will find fault with anything coming from the current inhabitants of the White House.It all started when First Lady Melania Trump and her team decided on 45 ruby red Christmas trees to decorate the White House.Volunteers from around the country assembled the trees over a three day period. They even taped their fingers in order to painstakingly transform the large styrofoam trees into beautiful cranberry trees.Only a few hundred people are picked out of the thousands who apply to decorate the White House each year. This was a dream job for Vickie Wenstrup. This is why it’s especially “horrible” that the left is bashing the hard work of the volunteers who spent days creating the magical decorations:Amelia Florist Vickie Wenstrup was caught off-guard by the “horrible” social media reaction to the red berry Christmas trees that she and a team of other volunteers labored over for three days:“I don’t know who first said it. Or why. The first thing I saw (on Google) was ‘Melania Trump covers the White House in blood for Christmas.'”USA Today reports:Wenstrup, a florist for 41 years, owns Amelia Florist and Gifts, about 16 miles southeast Cincinnati. Each year, she faithfully watches HGTV’s special about Christmas at the White House.
More than once, Wenstrup had mentioned to her husband of 38 years, Bruce, that she would love to help decorate the White House for Christmas.“I guess he took it upon himself to make that happen,” she said.In January, Bruce Wenstrup requested letters of recommendations from clients and assembled a portfolio. He filled several binders with favorable letters and other materials promoting his wife as an ideal volunteer. He sent copies to the first lady, her chief of staff, and the head floral designer.
In October, Bruce Wenstrup learned that his wife had been selected. He surprised her with the news on Oct. 27 over a family dinner. Vickie Wenstrup cried.“How do you repay somebody who gives you stuff like this. It’s a priceless gift,” Wenstrup said of her husband.This was a dream job for volunteers like Vickie. It’s too bad the classless critics are so selfish and can’t see that their fellow Americans proudly worked to create the vision for the 2018 White House Christmas theme of “American Treasures”.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT:Melania Trump made an appearance at Liberty University today looking lovely in a grey pantsuit.Former Fox News host Eric Bolling was interviewing the first lady (see video below) when the topic turned to the media trashing the White House Christmas decorations that were unveiled on Monday (see video below).Yes, apparently, there’s not enough news out there so the media immediately began trashing the decorations with ugly comments and memes.This is exactly what the media did last year when the first lady had white trees on display. This year, it’s the red trees that triggered the media who called the trees “bloody”. They said the white trees last year were like a scene from the horror movie “The Shining” and did the same thing this year with the red trees!  They also compared the trees to the “Handmaid’s Tale”:https://twitter.com/TechCurated/status/1067166540972347392Check out the beautiful trees in the video below:The trees last year were white and this year are red (see photo below).

So the president himself pins this on the Freedom Caucus, Club for Growth, Heritage Foundation. So essentially conservative interest groups and the most conservative caucus in the House, a caucus you were a member of just six months ago.MICK MULVANEY: Yeah, and I think there’s probably plenty of blame to go around. As we sat over the last two days and tried to figure out what happened, I think what happened is that Washington won. I think the one thing we learned this week is that Washington was a lot more broken than President Trump thought that it was.So what you have is the status quo wins and, unfortunately, the folks back home lost. You can blame it on the Freedom Caucus if you want to. But there’s also a lot of moderates, Charlie Dent will be on your show in a little bit, who are also against the bill. So it’s sort of the powers that be in Washington that won.CHUCK TODD: So the Republican Party–MICK MULVANEY: And the folks back home–CHUCK TODD: –has not changed Washington after taking over the House in ’10, taking over the Senate in ’14, and taking over the White House now?MICK MULVANEY: I think more importantly, we haven’t been able to change Washington in the first 65 days. And I think if there’s anything that’s disappointing and sort of an educational process to the Trump Administration was that this place was a lot more rotten than we thought that it was, and that I thought it was, because I’ve been here for six years. I know the Freedom Caucus. I helped found it. I never thought it would come to this. ",fake
367,14-Dec-18,"Reuters reports – Darlene Coker knew she was dying. She just wanted to know why.She knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.Coker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? “She wanted answers,” her daughter Cady Evans said.Fighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson’s Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson, alleging that “poisonous talc” in the company’s beloved product was her killer.J&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. “When you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,” he said. “We didn’t have it.”That was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company’s talc caused their cancers — including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.Watch the stunning investigative video here:The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators’ plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.",fake

372,13-Dec-18,"A New report by the DOJ reveals that they were unable to recover text messages from anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok and his lover, FBI attorney Lisa Page, who was also virulently anti-Trump, during the time period that they were working on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Peter Strzok wasn’t some low-level, hack agent at the FBI, he was the Chief of the Counterespionage Section. He also led the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server and the Russian election interference investigation. Strzok rose in the ranks to become the Deputy Assistant Director of the Counterintelligence Division, the second-highest position in that division.A December 11 2018, OIG report that’s been redacted for the public, reveals that iPhones issued by the special counsel’s office to Strzok and Page were reset after they left the special counsel probe in July 2017, making it impossible to retrieve text messages sent and received on those devices.From the OIG report:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]DOJ-issued iPhones six months earlier when their assignments to the SCO had ended. The 010 was told that the DOJ issued iPhone previously assigned to Strzok had been re-issued to another FBI agent following Strzok’s departure from the SCO. The SCO obtained the iPhone from that individual and provided it to the010. CYBER obtained a forensic extraction of the iPhone previously assigned to Strzok; however. this iPhone had been reset to factory settings and was reconfigured for the new user to whom the device was issued. It did not contain data related to Strzok’s use of the device. SCO’s Records Officer told the 010that as part of the office’s records retention procedure, the officer reviewed Strzok’s DOJ issued iPhone after he returned it to the SCO and determined it contained no substantive text messages.The SCO was unable to locate the iPhone previously assigned to Page, which had been returned to DOJ’s Justice Management Division (JMD). Subsequently, in early September 2018, JMD informed the OIG that it hadlocatedtheiPhonethathadbeenassignedtoPage. The OIG took custody of the device. Page’siPhonehad been reset to factory settings on July 31, 2017, but had not been reissued to a new user. (The Office of the Deputy Attorney General told the OJG that the Department routinely resets mobile devices to factory settings when the device is returned from a user to enable that device to be issued to another user in the future.) The OJG forensic review of the phone determined that it did not contain any data related to Page’s use of the device. SCO’s Records Otlicer stated that she did not receive the phone following Page’s departure from the $CO and therefore she did not review Page’s iPhone for records that would possibly need to be retained prior to the phone having been reset.According to the Daily Caller, Peter Strzok joined special counsel Robert Mueller’s team in early June 2017 and was removed in late July of that year after Horowitz informed the special counsel about the FBI officials’ anti-Trump messages. Page, who served as general counsel to then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, was detailed to Mueller’s investigation May 28, 2017. She left July 15, 2017, and since resigned from the bureau.The new OIG report focuses mostly on a five-month gap in messages between Strzok and Page. When investigators began looking at Strzok and Page’s FBI-issued phones, they found no messages from Dec. 13, 2016, to May 17, 2017, the same day Mueller was appointed special counsel.The FBI chalked the missing text messages up to a glitch that affected the message retention system on many FBI-issued phones. Government forensic analysts were able to recover many texts from the missing period. The OIG did not dispute the FBI’s claims about why the messages were missing from the phones.The phone Strzok used while he was on the Mueller team was inspected by a records officer with the special counsel, who found no “substantive” messages on the device. Page’s device was only recovered by the inspector general in September. It had been reset to factory settings July 31, 2017.The FBI accepts the fact that not all texts between Ms. Page and Mr. Strozk were collected by the FBl’s text collection tool but appreciates and agrees with the OIG’s conclusion and explanation that the content oftext messages exchanged between Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page did not appear to be a factor in their collection, or lack thereof. Further, theOIG did not find that the gaps in collection were intentional on the part ofthe FBI or any FBI personnel.It’s interesting to note, that on February 1, 2018, Sara Carter reported;Newly released text messages between a pair of FBI anti-Trump officials at the center of the Russia investigation controversy show that they sought to “get around” rules established by the government to preserve text messages, stating that none of the agencies abide by the rules then “why should we.”Former FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page discussed getting new Apple iPhones, in lieu of their Samsung 5 government issued phones in text messages they exchanged in August 2016. They noted in the texts that the new phones would help keep their text messages from government collection after speaking with the FBI’s IT director, according to newly released August 2016 text messages.NOTHING TO SEE HERE…",fake

McCarthy said there’s not a federal judge in America that would give him jail time, saying he committed a “process crime” that comes with a 0-6 months sentence. McCarthy reminded everyone that General Flynn is a first offender with a “30-year history of decorated service to the United States.” McCarthy pointed out the propaganda game Meuller is playing with the public when he asked for what the judge is going to do anyway,” to not give him a jail sentence. McCarthy claims Mueller’s going to claim that he’s going to bat for Flynn because he gave them “explosive cooperation”, and that he used documents that were blacked out all over the place to make it look like there’s redacted information Flynn gave them underneath the blacked out copy on the documents.Oh, the tricks the Deep State plays…Watch:THE HEADLINER: @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox @AndrewCMcCarthy discussed Michael Flynn saying the @FBI pushed him to answer questions without a lawyer #nine2noon pic.twitter.com/fatvyWOTk8— America's Newsroom (@AmericaNewsroom) December 12, 2018Politico is reporting – Adding new details to the extent of Flynn’s cooperation, his lawyers said he spent about 62 hours and 45 minutes meeting with the government. Flynn also produced thousands of documents for the Justice Department, including materials before he pleaded guilty dealing with his two security companies.

They also noted that Papadopoulos was warned that lying to investigators was a federal offense.As for Van Der Zwaan, who spent 30 days in prison before being deported, the Flynn attorneys argued that he was a “trained attorney who was represented by counsel” during his FBI interview. They also said Mueller’s inquiry by the time Van Der Zwaan committed his offense was a “publicly disclosed, full-bore investigation” dealing with the 2016 election. ",fake

Get out the yellow vests because a 20-30 cent tax raise on gas is a big move by the mayor that people will fight against. Illinois is becoming the new California. They’re in debt up to their eyeballs yet they bleed tax dollars to support the freebies.Emanuel spoke alongside community leaders who support the tax:“We are facing a historic moment, and I stand with a group of bipartisan mayors on behalf of a new transportation bill that should happen in Springfield,” Emanuel said alongside the mayors of Park Forest, Hazel Crest, Oswego, Fox River Grove, Joliet, Batavia, Broadview and Ford Heights.“Our state can’t wait any longer,” Emanuel continued. “Over the last four years, we’ve been stuck in neutral and the states in the surrounding area — Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Iowa just to name a few — have passed transportation bills with gas tax increases.” The mayor noted all of the states were controlled by Republican governors and legislatures at the time of the tax increases.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The Chicago Tribune reports:Illinois last raised the gas tax from 16 cents per gallon to 19 cents in 1990.

McCarthy said there’s not a federal judge in America that would give him jail time, saying he committed a “process crime” that comes with a 0-6 months sentence. McCarthy reminded everyone that General Flynn is a first offender with a “30-year history of decorated service to the United States.” McCarthy pointed out the propaganda game Meuller is playing with the public when he asked for what the judge is going to do anyway,” to not give him a jail sentence. McCarthy claims Mueller’s going to claim that he’s going to bat for Flynn because he gave them “explosive cooperation”, and that he used documents that were blacked out all over the place to make it look like there’s redacted information Flynn gave them underneath the blacked out copy on the documents.Oh, the tricks the Deep State plays…Watch:THE HEADLINER: @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox @AndrewCMcCarthy discussed Michael Flynn saying the @FBI pushed him to answer questions without a lawyer #nine2noon pic.twitter.com/fatvyWOTk8— America's Newsroom (@AmericaNewsroom) December 12, 2018Politico is reporting – Adding new details to the extent of Flynn’s cooperation, his lawyers said he spent about 62 hours and 45 minutes meeting with the government.

388,10-Dec-18,"The former Chief Financial Officer of the Clinton Foundation slushfund, Andrew Kessel, is a whistleblower and he’s not holding anything back. As it relates to the Clinton’s, Kessel told investigators that the Clinton Foundation has been corrupt for some time and offered some inside knowledge, saying he  “knows where the bodies are buried.”John Soloman of The Hill reports – When a House subcommittee chairman bangs his gavel next week to convene an unprecedented investigative hearing into the Clinton Foundation, two questions will linger as preeminent: Is the Clinton family charity really the international do-gooder that earned a perfect four-star rating from Charity Navigator, or does it suffer from corruption and illegalities as conservatives allege? And if it is the latter, how much evidence of wrongdoing does the government possess?The answer to the first question is that the foundation and its projects reported collecting about $2.5 billion to help global crises, from AIDS to earthquakes, even as its own auditors, lawyers and employees privately warned of problems over the years.The answer to the second question may reside in 6,000 pages of evidence attached to a whistleblower submission filed secretly more than a year ago with the IRS and FBI.The 48-page submission, dated Aug. 11, 2017, supports its claims with 95 exhibits, including internal legal reviews that the foundation conducted on itself in 2008 and 2011.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Those reviews flagged serious concerns about legal compliance, improper commingling of personal and charity business and “quid pro quo” promises made to donors while Hillary Clinton was secretary of State.The submission also cites an interview its investigators conducted with Andrew Kessel that quotes the foundation’s longtime chief financial officer as saying he was unable to stop former President Clinton from “commingling” personal business and charitable activities inside the foundation and that he “knows where all the bodies are buried.”“There is probable cause that the Clinton Foundation has run afoul of IRS rules regarding tax-exempt charitable organizations and has acted inconsistently with its stated purpose,” MDA Analytics alleged in its submission. “The Foundation should be investigated for all of the above-mentioned improprieties. The tax rules, codes, statutes and the rule of law should and must be applied in this case.”“It is a very good roadmap for investigation,” said retired FBI supervisory agent Jeffrey Danik, a prior practicing certified public accountant who helped the bureau make some of its most complex financial fraud and terrorism cases during a 29-year career.“When you have the organization’s own lawyers using words like ‘quid pro quo,’ ‘conflicts of interest’ and ‘whistleblower protections,’ you have enough to get permission to start interviewing and asking questions,” he said.Kessel told those investigators that “one of the biggest problems was Mr. Clinton’s commingling and use of business and donated funds and his personal expenses,” according to the whistleblower submission.“There is no controlling Bill Clinton. He does whatever he wants and runs up incredible expenses with foundation funds,” states a separate interview memo attached to the submission.“Bill Clinton mixes and matches his personal business with that of the foundation. Many people within the foundation have tried to caution him about this but he does not listen, and there really is no talking to him,” the memo added.The memo also claims Kessel confirmed to the private investigators that private lawyers reviewed the foundation’s practices — once in 2008 and the other in 2011 — and each found widespread problems with governance, accounting and conflicts of interest.“I have addressed it before and, let me tell you, I know where all the bodies are buried in this place,” the memo alleges Kessel said.The evidence amassed by the private investigators should give Congress plenty to explore at its hearing next week, and put the Trump Justice Department on the spot to answer what it has done to address concerns that the foundation’s lawyers raised and the private investigators uncovered.Quid pro quo donations, a culture of noncompliance, travel abuses and commingling of personal with charitable business are serious issues, especially when Americans trusted the Clinton Foundation to spend $2.5 billion tax free in the name of charity.Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton released a video today, where he talked about their new lawsuit against the DOJ, saying it looks like they supressed the “Clinton Foundation issue.” Fitton says he’ll be testifying in front of Congress next week to address the Clinton’s pay-to-play scandal while Hillary was Secretary of State, and the comingling of funds by former president, Bill Clinton.The real ""collusion"" scandal is hand-in-hand effort by Clinton campaign and the Obama DOJ & FBI to spy on and destroy @realDonaldTrump. And JW's new lawsuit aims to get to the bottom of this massive scandal. Congress asked Comey q's about this but only @JudicialWatch is in court. pic.twitter.com/8teqitIz5I— Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) December 10, 2018Sixteen FBI agents raided the home of a recognized Department of Justice whistleblower who privately delivered documents pertaining to the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One to a government watchdog, according to the whistleblower’s attorney.The Justice Department’s inspector general was informed that the documents show that federal officials failed to investigate potential criminal activity regarding former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation and Rosatom, the Russian company that purchased Uranium One, a document reviewed by The Daily Caller News Foundation alleges.“The bureau raided my client to seize what he legally gave Congress about the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One,” the whistleblower’s lawyer, Michael Socarras, told TheDCNF, noting that he considered the FBI’s raid to be an “outrageous disregard” of whistleblower protections.Sixteen agents arrived at the home of Dennis Nathan Cain, a former FBI contractor, on the morning of Nov. 19 and raided his Union Bridge, Maryland, home, Socarras told TheDCNF.The raid was permitted by a court order signed on Nov. 15 by federal magistrate Stephanie A. Gallagher in the U.S. District Court for Baltimore and obtained by TheDCNF.A special agent from the FBI’s Baltimore division, who led the raid, charged that Cain possessed stolen federal property and demanded entry to his private residence, Socarras told TheDCNF.From the New York Times article:A January 2013 article: “Russian Nuclear Energy Conquers the World” detailed how the Russian atomic energy agency, Rosatom, had taken over a Canadian company with uranium-mining stakes stretching from Central Asia to the American West. The deal made Rosatom one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.But the untold story behind that story is one that involves not just the Russian president, but also a former American president and a woman who would like to be the next one.At the heart of the tale are several men, leaders of the Canadian mining industry, who have been major donors to the charitable endeavors of former President Bill Clinton and his family. Members of that group built, financed and eventually sold off to the Russians a company that would become known as Uranium One.Beyond mines in Kazakhstan that are among the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave the Russians control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the United States. Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies. Among the agencies that eventually signed off was the State Department, then headed by Mr. Clinton’s wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.The New York Times’s examination of the Uranium One deal is based on dozens of interviews, as well as a review of public records and securities filings in Canada, Russia and the United States. Some of the connections between Uranium One and the Clinton Foundation were unearthed by Peter Schweizer, a former fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution and author of the forthcoming book “Clinton Cash.” Mr. Schweizer provided a preview of material in the book to The Times, which scrutinized his information and built upon it with its own reporting.Whether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown. But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation’s donors.",fake
389,10-Dec-18,"Liberal students don’t want to see the life of conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, honored in the city where he grew up.  Instead, they want to make sure he is appropriately punished and dishonored for daring to be a black man with conservative views. The only problem is, they can’t quite explain why they want him dishonored. United States Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was born in a small coastal town in Pin Point, GA, where he lived in abject poverty. He was two years old and living in a one-room shack with a dirt floor and no plumbing when his father walked out on their family. His mother attempted to support he and his younger brother, but after a horrible house fire that left them homeless, his mother turned to her parents, asking them to raise her two boys. Clarence Thomas’ maternal grandparents, who were descendants of slaves, raised Clarence Thomas and his younger brother in Savannah, GA, providing them with the best education they could afford. Clarence Thomas became a Supreme Court Justice in 1991. Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Liberal students at Savannah College of Arts and Design (tuition + room and board = approx $60,000) would now like to see Justice Thomas’ name removed from a building on their campus, honoring the humble Justice Thomas for his outstanding achievements.An unbelievable video that has just been released shows Campus Reform’s media director, Cabot Phillips, interviewing students at Savannah College of Arts and Design about a petition that’s been circulating around campus. Organizers are asking students to sign the petition, as a show of support for removing Justice Clarence Thomas’ name from a campus building.In the interview, the students almost unanimously agreed that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who was raised by his grandparents in Savannah, GA. The only problem is, they don’t know why his name should be removed. This video should be alarming for anyone who watches it. It shows how easily our youth is indoctrinated into believing whatever their leftist professors or peers tell them, without even questioning why they believe what they’re being told. One of the students isn’t sure why he wants the name of the building changed, saying that all he know is that Justice Thomas is a “historical figure, but so was Hitler”…huh???Watch:From Campus Reform:One student, after saying she would sign the petition, admitted, “I don’t know I haven’t done much research on this. I just saw the petition and that’s the extent of it.” Another student in support of the petition echoed a similar sentiment, saying, “well I don’t actually know what he did,” while yet another added, “I really don’t know anything about him.”One student went so far as to compare Thomas to Hitler, though when asked if he could name anything Thomas had done to justify such a comparison, the student admitted, “I mean not in particular.”While most students supported the petition, there were those in opposition. One such student said they believed “just because you don’t agree with someone doesn’t mean you shouldn’t honor them.”Another student had a message for those who had signed the petition: “If you don’t align with someone it doesn’t mean they’re bad. It doesn’t mean they’re wrong or that you’re right. Do your own research and find the middle ground between you and that person.”   ",fake
390,10-Dec-18,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has gone out of his way to defend decisions made by the Twitter censorship team that led to banning accounts of popular conservatives over “racist”, “homophobic” or “hateful” tweets.Last March, Dorsey tweeted: We’re committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.We’re committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress.— jack (@jack) March 1, 2018Dorsey continued…Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]We have witnessed abuse, harassment, troll armies, manipulation through bots and human-coordination, misinformation campaigns, and increasingly divisive echo chambers.

This is the approach we now need.This tweet shows Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey standing next to a white man wearing a durag on his head with his black paint on his lips to make them appear excessively large. Dorsey’s caption read: “Adam bought a durag and $40 worth of makeup: costume complete.”In another tweet, Dorsey reported that he was seated next to a “transvestite” on an airplane. Isn’t Dorsey violating that rules set forth by the politically correct gay mafia in his tweet, by referring to the individual next to him as a “transvestite” instead of a “transgender?” And wouldn’t his tweet, that is clearly making fun of the person who is not like him, violate all social norms as determined by the Left?Are Dorsey’s tweets considered “acceptable”, while tweets by top conservatives like the recently banned account of independent, conservative journalist, Laura Loomer, who was removed for tweeting about a newly elected pro-Sharia US Congresswoman, considered “unacceptable?”It’s been one month since Fox News posted a tweet. While they aren’t saying specifically why they are no longer tweeting from any of their accounts, it is likely that their decision stems from an event that took place one month ago, when Fox News’ Tucker Carlson was doxed on Twitter, which led to Antifa terrrorists showing up at his home, threatening his family.According to Western Journal – A content manager for Tribune Media, Scott Gustin, tweeted back in November that he was told by a Fox employee that the decision to silence the Twitter accounts was made “from the highest level” and that the silence would persist until the company removed tweets of Carlson’s address and apologized for improperly handling the incident.The @SmashRacismDC Twitter account accused of originally posting the address and organizing the protest at Carlson’s home was only suspended, and is back up and running already.Here’s one of the last tweets from @SmashRacismDC before their account was SUSPENDED…not SHUT DOWN, but SUSPENDED for doxing Tucker Carslon:The double standard for conservatives and liberals on Twitter is stunning. Multiple death threats against President Trump that were made months ago, are still up on the social media platform. Celebrities seem to enjoy a special kind of privilvege when threatening President Trump and/or his family.Conservative Robby Starbuck makes a great point with his tweet, asking how washed-up entertainer, Bette Midler’s tweet, calling for the hanging of President Trump is allowed to remain on Twitter?If a Republican actor said Obama and his family would be hung they would’ve been banned or suspended. @BetteMidler posts a tweet saying @realDonaldTrump and his family will be hung by Mueller yet @Twitter @Jack do nothing about it.

-Kid RockAccording to Variety – Bryan Lewis, the attorney for Steve Smith, Kid Rock’s business partner and “best friend,” told Variety Friday night that the controversial performer was planning on showing up and fulfilling his duty as grand marshal Saturday morning. That’s even though parade organizers have already invited James Shaw Jr., aka “the Waffle House hero,” to be the grand marshal in his stead.Kid Rock “will show up and is going to try to participate as grand marshal tomorrow,” declared Lewis. But if a local hero, Shaw, has officially been assigned that role in his stead, who should Nashville expect to actually head up the parade?“My best analogy is it’ll be a standoff at high noon,” Lewis said. Given the early, frigid start time for Saturday’s festivities, he corrected himself: “I guess it’ll be a standoff at 8 a.m.”Lewis said his client, Smith, has given $250,000 a year annually to the city for the parade for the last two years, since Piedmont pulled out as majority sponsor. “It’s like stockholders in a corporation,” Lewis said. “Mr. Smith owns 95 percent of the stock. The other 5 percent of the people who hold stock held a closed-meeting excluding Mr. Smith and made a unilateral decision to exclude Kid Rock from the parade. It is our belief that, as the major contributor, Mr. Smith has the right to name the grand marshal of the parade.”Smith is the owner of Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge and several other bars in Nashville’s tourist-oriented Lower Broad district — and, with his celebrity friend, he’s co-owner of a brand new nightspot, Kid Rock’s Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock N’ Roll Steakhouse. That was the site of the live “Fox & Friends” remote broadcast Friday morning that led to a quick apology from host Steve Doocy.The resulting firestorm led Mayor David Briley’s office to issue a statement: “If Kid Rock is still the grand marshal tomorrow, the mayor is inclined not to participate.” Councilman Freddie O’Connell was also among those vowing to skip the parade if Kid Rock stayed.An announcement that he was out came late in the day Friday. “Parade organizers feel that the grand marshal should personify the spirit of the Nashville community and have invited James Shaw, Jr., who became a community hero after stopping a shooting at a local Waffle House earlier this year, to be honored,” organizers said.Lewis told Variety that Smith is looking at filing a lawsuit, saying, “We’re doing our due diligence and background to pursue a potential legal action against Tennessee Holiday Productions… and other parties involved in the decision today to exclude Kid Rock.”  ",fake

397,07-Dec-18,"Where’s Macron?Last week, during the G-20 conference in Argentina, the unpopular “President Of The Elite,” Emmanuel Macron, implored the citizens of France to stop the violence on the streets of Paris. President Trump was the lone dissenter in a group of 20 leaders who reaffirmed their commitment to the costly Paris climate accord.In December 2017, Forbes reported about the One Planet Summit, hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron. The summit marked the two-year anniversary of the signing of the Paris climate agreement in the French capital, and it was meant to affirm the world’s commitment to the deal despite Donald Trump’s announcement in June that he will take the U.S. out of the accord.The previous month, in Bonn, Macron said Europe should take the lead in filling the financing gap left by the U.S., which has said it will stop contributing climate finance. Europe heeded Macron’s call. Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s energy chief, came to Paris with an “action plan for the planet” in hand, containing commitments for €9 billion in climate finance for countries outside Europe to combat and adapt to climate change.“It is not that funding or financing is not available,” he told the summit attendees in Paris. “In Europe, we have the ambition to be the hotbed of urban innovation. This is why we support local climate action through EU funds, with at least 20% of the EU budget going into climate-related projects.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“Forgotten France” however, doesn’t appear to agree with the plan to increase taxes on every day French residents who are struggling to get by. For three weeks now, they’ve been ramping up the violence in the streets of Paris, as they riot to protest the ecologically motivated, increasingly out of control taxes related to the Paris climate change agreement.BREAKING: France protests turn violent, as yellow-jacket protesters begin clashing with police. One thing is becoming abundantly clear, these protests are not about a ""gas tax increase."" They want corrupt globalist Macron to step down. pic.twitter.com/Rf8zrJzI2s— Mike Tokes (@MikeTokes) December 6, 2018This image, that’s being circulated on social media perfectly represents how every day French residents feel about Macron’s oppressive tax scheme…Now, Fox News is reporting that as France braces for another round of violent protests this weekend in Paris and the rest of the country, embattled French President Emmanuel Macron is a missing man as his government tries to curb the chaos caused in part by his unpopular plan to hike gas taxes.Macron swept into power in 2017, having emerged out of obscurity less than a year earlier. Espousing his own brand of centrism, he has presented himself on the world stage as a spokesman for multilateralism and internationalism against a nationalist wave moving through Europe.While he has regularly been seen on world stages, including the United Nations and the U.S. Congress, he has been conspicuous by his absence this week, choosing to keep away from the limelight as his government attempts to deal with the issues being protested by the “yellow jacket” protesters who have protested and even rioted in cities over France in recent weeks.Macron had initially stood firm on the hikes, saying they were necessary to combat climate change and France’s reliance on oil. But on Wednesday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced that the government was scrapping the tax hike altogether. A government spokesman also suggested on French radio that a wealth tax that Macron ended last year could be re-introduced.The French government has said that 89,000 additional police officers and law enforcement personnel — with 8,000 in Paris — had been mobilized ahead of Saturday to head off planned protests, which show no sign of slowing down, despite the damage control by the government.But as ministers scramble, Macron himself has been neither seen nor heard, leading to criticism from his political opponents. Marine Le Pen, Macron’s right-wing 2017 presidential election rival, urged Macron on Wednesday to meet with the protesters before Saturday.“Do not hide at the Elysee, do not ask others to do what the French expect of you, listen to them, hear them before Saturday,” she told reporters.Perhaps France’s very unpopular “Green President” has bitten off a little more than he can chew…",fake

This is funny!He posted a meme on Instagram that made the claim that the policies of socialism will cause Americans to eat their dogs.

Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Trump was making a reference to the fact that the socialist country of Venezuela asked its citizens to eat their pets. We’re not kidding!“GENERALLY, VENEZUELANS DO NOT EAT RABBITS AND SEE THEM AS PETS…”The Venezuelan government just urged its citizens to eat their pet rabbits so they won’t starve to death. A severe food crisis is part of the socialist utopia that just keeps going downhill. What’s next? Cannibalism?President Nicolas Maduro unveiled a government program called  “Plan Rabbit” at a meeting with his agriculture minister, Freddy Bernal, that was broadcast on Periscope, CNN Money reported. It’s a plan to distribute rabbits to communities across Venezuela to breed and eat. Maduro noted that rabbits breed quickly and are a good source of protein, but not cholesterol.GOVERNMENT PUSHES A “CHANGE IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS”“The rabbit isn’t a pet, it’s only two and a half kilos of meat,” Bernal stressed in the streamed announcement. He then invoked President Donald Trump to push the program.“Trump’s attack against the Venezuelan people is an opportunity to revise and change cultural consumption patterns,” he said.Venezuelan opposition leaders immediately slammed the move.“Are you serious?” asked former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles in a video response. “You want people to start raising rabbits to solve the problem of hunger in our country?”A 2016 study found that three-fourths of Venezuelans had lost almost twenty pounds on average over the course of the year. Meat is particularly scarce in the South American nation, with citizens even resorting to butchering zoo animals, according to police.Most economists agree the mass hunger is the result of socialist government policies spearheaded by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and Maduro, his successor. Chavez instituted price controls on many food items, which helped lead to shortages and massive inflation.We’ve previously reported on shortages of food and even toilet paper in Venezuela.BYOTP! NO TOILET PAPER AND NO FOODSocialism doesn’t work but I guess Venezuela didn’t get the memo. No toilet paper? No food? Yes, it’s come to that in this socialist hellhole…Venezuela’s product shortages have become so severe that some hotels in that country are asking guests to bring their own toilet paper and soap, a local tourism industry spokesman said on Wednesday….
“It’s an extreme situation,” says Xinia Camacho, owner of a 20-room boutique hotel in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada national park. “For over a year we haven’t had toilet paper, soap, any kind of milk, coffee or sugar. So we have to tell our guests to come prepared.”…
Montilla says bigger hotels can circumvent product shortages by buying toilet paper and other basic supplies from black market smugglers who charge up to 6-times the regular price. But smaller, family-run hotels can’t always afford to pay such steep prices, which means that sometimes they have to make do without.READ MORE: WFB ",fake

Darrell Issa, R-Calif., told reporters that some lawmakers have been frustrated with the testimony so far and that Comey didn’t seem upset about being told by his lawyers that he doesn’t have to answer certain questions.“One of the disappointments of this deposition so far has been the amount of times in which the FBI believes that Congress doesn’t have a right to know,” Issa said.Issa said Comey has two attorneys, including one from the DOJ, who have “instructed” the former FBI director not to answer “a great many questions that are clearly items at the core of our investigation.” Issa said the instructions have been followed with Comey’s “gleeful acceptance.”“The Department of Justice is going to have to agree to allow him to come back and answer a great many questions that currently he is not answering,” Issa said.Comey, who may publicly speak at some point Friday, initially fought the committee’s subpoena to appear in court but finally forged an agreement to appear. The committee is expected to release a transcript of the interview, perhaps as early as Saturday.“The details of what’s going on in there will remain private until after the deposition,” Issa said. “… [T]here is an amazing amount of things that reasonably the public will need to know that the Department of Justice and FBI attorney are guiding him not to answer.”The former FBI director declined to answer shouted questions from Fox News as he entered the hearing room Friday morning.

400,07-Dec-18,"Former administration officials who bash our president like former SOS Rex Tillerson did today, should be reminded of what a great honor it is to serve the people. His job was to be loyal to the president and follow the policies therein. Tillerson was fired because he was disloyal to President Trump. See the examples below.It goes without saying that Tillerson might have caught the “Hillary Clinton Sour Grapes Disease”. He was in Texas today bashing President Trump like crazy.  He basically said President Trump is impulsive, doesn’t read and tries to do things that are against the law:Tillerson in Texas: “So often, the president would say here’s what I want to do and here’s how I want to do it and I would have to say to him, Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can’t do it that way. It violates the law.”All we can say is that disloyal ex-government employees like Tillerson aren’t to be believed. After all, the guy was fired by Trump!Newsweek published examples where Tillerson went against the president’s wishes. Tillerson earned his pink slip!Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]HERE ARE FIVE REASONS WHY TRUMP MAY HAVE FIRED TILLERSON ACCORDING TO NEWSWEEK:1. Tillerson said that while it wasn’t clear “whether the spy attack came from Russia with the Russian government’s knowledge,” he trusted “the U.K.’s investigation and its assessment that Russia was likely responsible for the nerve agent attack.”Tillerson’s response broke with the White House line, which stopped short of blaming Russia for the attack. Tillerson also told reporters that the attack would “certainly trigger a response.”2. Trump challenged his top diplomat to an IQ test after it was reported that Tillerson had called him a “moron” after a meeting at the Pentagon. During that meeting, Trump had called for an increase in America’s nuclear weapons stockpiles in contravention of international treaties. “I can tell you who is going to win,” the president told Forbes during an interview later.3. Trump and Tillerson have clashed over the administration’s approach to North Korea and its intensifying nuclear weapons program. Last summer, as tensions rose when Kim Jong Un and Trump traded insults, Tillerson said the U.S. wanted to “resolve this through talks” rather than the military options that the White House said were on the table.Last week, Tillerson said an upcoming meeting between Trump and Kim would focus on “talks” rather than “negotiations.” Yet the president appears to expect a deal with Kim on denuclearization.4. Trump disagreed with Tillerson’s policy approaches on whether the U.S. should mediate in a dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The two also disagreed on whether the U.S. should pull out of the Iran deal brokered in 2015 to stop the country’s development of nuclear weapons.5. Tillerson almost quit in frustration last year, according to reports, after Trump publicly berated Attorney General Jeff Sessions over his decision to step away from the Russia investigation. Several sources told CNN that Tillerson believed the president’s behavior was unprofessional.The bottom line is Tillerson repeatedly went against the Trump administration policy.",fake

403,07-Dec-18,"According to multiple Fox News sources, President Trump will tweet Friday morning that he is nominating State Department Spokeswoman Heather Nauert to be the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, replacing outgoing official Nikki Haley.Back in October, Nauert, a former Fox News host, was believed to be a “leading contender” for the position, sources familiar with the selection process said at the time.Haley unexpectedly announced her resignation in October and promised to serve in her role through the end of 2018. At the time, she described her time in the position as a “blessing,” but offered no reason for leaving except a belief that government officials must know “when it’s time to step aside.”In her resignation letter, she also dismissed the possibility of running in the 2020 election.“I expect to continue to speak out from time to time on important public policy matters, but I will surely not be a candidate for any office in 2020,” she wrote. “As a private citizen, I look forward to supporting your re-election as President, and supporting the policies that will continue to move our great country toward even greater heights.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Haley discussed her affection and admiration for the Trump family in this very touching televised announcement of her decision to resign from her post as UN Ambassador:I want to say — first of all, I want to thank the President for just, you know, allowing us to come out and talk to you this way. It has been an honor of a lifetime. You know, I said I am such a lucky girl to have been able to lead the state that raised me, and to serve a country I love so very much. It has really been a blessing, and I want to thank you for that.But I’m most excited — look at the two years. Look at what has happened in two years with the United States on foreign policy. Now, the United States is respected. Countries may not like what we do, but they respect what we do. They know that if we say we’re going to do something, we follow it through. And the President proved that — whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria; whether it’s with NATO — saying that other countries have to pay their share; I mean, whether it’s the trade deals, which has been amazing. They get that the President means business, and they follow through with that.But then if you look at just these two years at the U.N., we cut $1.3 billion in the U.N.’s budget. We’ve made it stronger. We’ve made it more efficient.South Sudan — we got an arms embargo, which was a long time coming.Three North Korean sanctions packages, which were the largest in a generation, done in a way that we could really work towards denuclearizing North Korea.The Iran deal — bringing attention to the world that every country needs to understand you can’t overlook all of the bad things they’re doing; you have to see them for the threat that they are.I think you look at the anti-Israel bias, and the strength and courage that the President showed in moving the embassy, and showing the rest of the world we will put our embassy where we want to put our embassy.You know, all of those things have made a huge difference in the U.S. standing. But I can tell you that it’s — the U.S. is strong again. And the U.S. is strong in a way that should make all Americans very proud.And I do want to say that it’s not just the President I want to thank. The family in general — the First Lady has been nothing but very, very kind to me.I can’t say enough good things about Jared and Ivanka. Jared is such a hidden genius that no one understands. I mean, to re-do the NAFTA deal the way he did. What I’ve done working with him on the Middle East Peace Plan — it is so unbelievably well done.And Ivanka has been just a great friend. And they do a lot of things behind the scenes that I wish more people knew about because we’re a better country because they’re in this administration.I also just have to say, certainly, thank you to my family. Michael is a saint. And my two little ones, I adore them.And to Team U.S.-U.N. You know, they sacrificed a lot. They put a lot of time and energy into it. But they have a lot of heart, and really wanted to make America proud.And so, with that, I’m not leaving until the end of the year. My goal is that we make sure that everything is in good place, and — for the next ambassador to come in. But it’s a great day in the United States. And I’m proud to have been part of a team.Now, I don’t have anything set on where I’m going to go. I think that the main thing was — I was Governor for six years, and we dealt with the Hurricane, a thousand-year flood, a church shooting, a school shooting. There was a lot. And then, to come in and do two years of Russia and Iran and North Korea — it’s been eight years of intense time, and I’m a believer in term limits.I think you have to be selfless enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job. So, thank you, Mr. President —It’s been an honor of a lifetime. And I will say this: For all of you that are going to ask about 2020; no, I’m not running for 2020. I can promise you what I’ll be doing is campaigning for this one. So, I look forward to supporting the President in the next election.",fake

It exempts active duty members of the military and the police, as well as retired law enforcement officers, permitting them to carry semi-automatic handguns that hold 15 rounds of ammunition.“New Jersey’s law reasonably fits the state’s interest in public safety and does not unconstitutionally burden the Second Amendment’s right to self-defense in the home,” wrote 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Patty Shwartz, an Obama-appointee.A group of gun rights advocates challenged the law and had sought an injunction, saying it banned a whole category of firearms.But the court, in a 2-1 ruling, said that wasn’t true. Judge Shwartz said a limit on magazines, doesn’t take any guns out of Americans’ hands, and said it also doesn’t limit the number of rounds available. Someone could still purchase three 10-round magazines, giving them the equivalent of two now-banned 15-round magazines.The court said New Jersey had a valid public safety interest that change.“The record demonstrates that when there are pauses in shooting to reload or for other reasons, opportunities arise for victims to flee, as evidenced by the 2017 Las Vegas and 2013 D.C. Navy Yard shootings… or for bystanders to intervene, as in the 2018 Tennessee Waffle House shooting and 2011 Arizona shooting involving Representative Gabrielle Giffords,” the court ruled.Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee, dissented, saying the state didn’t meet its burden of proof to show the law was necessary.Keep reading… ",fake

The idea that a black man, especially a black celebrity like Kanye West would dare to desert the Party whose only goal appears to be destroying Donald Trump and anyone attached to him, has leftist heads spinning.On Thursday morning, the rap star will meet with President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then have lunch with Trump himself, according to a person familiar with the plans.The visit is the latest development in a budding relationship between Trump and West, who met at Trump Tower in New York during the 2016 presidential transition and have exchanged flattering tweets over the past year.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said they’ll talk about manufacturing, prison reform, preventing gang violence and reducing violence in Chicago, where West grew up. In September, West told a group of high schoolers he is moving back to Chicago. –Chicago TribuneThe Left is panicked, and they’re losing their composure.Tonight, during a segment with CNN host Don Lemon, Bakari Sellers, a CNN political analyst and former Dem Rep in Lindsey Graham’s home state of South Carolina, revealed how desperate the liberal black community is, to keep Kaney on the Democrat plantation, when he leveled a disgusting and ugly slur at mega-rap star Kanye West, saying, “Kanye’s what happens when negroes don’t read.”Watch:Breaking Video: Bakari Sellers, a CNN Political Analyst and former Representative of South Carolina, says that “Kanye West is what happens when negros don’t read” https://t.co/dN5UGUsbm9— Correct Wing (@CorrectWinger) October 10, 2018Chicago Tribune reports – West’s recent involvement with his home city has included an unverified Twitter announcement about teaching at the School of the Art Institute in Chicago, talk of restoring the Regal Theatre, mention of bringing a Yeezy shoes office to the city and accusations that he has neglected Donda’s House, a Chicago-based youth nonprofit named for his mother.West also made headlines last month for a pro-Trump speech at the end of his appearance on “Saturday Night Live,” which didn’t make the air.

408,05-Dec-18,"Trump supporters deserted the Fox News regular commentator Judge Napolitano a long time ago, over his constant bashing of President Trump and his administration.Earlier today, Judge Napolitano joined ABC News chief legal analyst Dan Abrams on his SiriusXM show to discuss Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s press release about Lt General Michael Flynn yesterday.ABC News reports- The admission by President Trump’s longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen that he lied to Congress about the Trump Organization’s plans to build a Trump-branded skyscraper in Moscow has brought new scrutiny upon the sworn testimony of other Trump associates – including his oldest son.According to two congressional sources familiar with the questioning of Trump Organization employees, several people tied to the Trump Organization were asked about the same Moscow project. Their answers – in light of Cohen’s admission – could put them in the investigators’ crosshairs.During his appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2017, Donald Trump Jr. was asked about efforts to build Trump Tower projects in Moscow.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Senators discussed at least two potential developments involving the Trumps. Trump Jr. said one involving the family’s partners in the Miss Universe Pageant “died of deal fatigue” by the end of 2014.“Certainly not ’16,” Trump Jr. said. “There was never a definitive end to it.”The proposed deal being worked by Cohen came soon after. Trump Jr. said he knew “very little” about that proposal, other than that he believed his father had signed a letter of intent to pursue it. Court filings, however, suggest members of Trump’s family were looped into discussions about the proposed deal, referring to Trump as “Individual 1.”“[Cohen] briefed family members of Individual 1 within the company about the project,” the filing said.According to Mediaite – The words “substantial assistance” came up in the discussion and Napolitano dropped a bombshell opinion that he felt like Donald Trump Jr was going to be indicted by Mueller’s investigation.Napolitano––who hosts the new Fox Nation program Liberty File––said it’s a “huge deal” and noted that Flynn has been cooperating with Mueller’s office for quite a while now. He brought up the possibility of a connection between the Trump investigations and the Deutsche Bank raid, before saying “the President himself should be extremely uncomfortable about this.”Abrams asked if he expects anyone in the President’s inner circle is going to get indicted.“Yes,” Napolitano said. “I don’t know who, but I do know that Donald Jr. has told friends he expects to be indicted.”“Do you expect he’d be indicted?” Abrams asked.“Yes,” Napolitano answered.Listen:  Wrestling with the little ones earlier this fall when it wasn’t 6 degrees outside. #thanksgiving #weekend #kids #outdoorsA post shared by  Donald Trump Jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) on Nov 23, 2018 at 7:41am PST",fake

413,05-Dec-18,"Former President George W. Bush delivered a heartfelt and sometimes humorous eulogy today at the end of the funeral for his father. Watch the video below and you’ll see how he gently touches the casket as he walks by.The National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., was the location for the service for former President George H.W. Bush. several dignitaries spoke but the most touching was from George W. Bush because he shared moments of love he showed to his family and friends.The most personal and touching moment in the 10-minute speech by the former president was when it was time for a final goodbye:“Last Friday when I was told he had minutes to live, I called him.  I said ‘Dad, I love you and you’ve been a wonderful father.’ And the last words he would ever say on earth were, ‘I love you, too.'”The eulogy was not only about how Bush 43’s father died but how he lived a life of fullness a vigor:“I once heard it said of man that the idea is to die young as late as possible.”“He taught us that a day was not meant to be wasted. He played golf at a legendary pace. I always wonder why he insisted on speed golf. Here’s my conclusion: he played fast so he could move on to the next event, to enjoy the rest of the day, to expend his enormous energy, to live it all.”“He was born with just two settings, full throttle, then sleep.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“Service is noble”“Dad could relate to people from all walks of life. He was an empathetic man. He valued character over pedigree, and he was no cynic. He looked for the good in each person and he usually found it. Dad taught us that public service is noble and necessary, that one can serve with integrity and hold true to the important values like faith and family. He strongly believed that it was important to give back to the community and country in which one lived. He recognized that serving others enriched the giver’s soul.”Bush went on to discuss the pain of his father losing a child to leukemia:“None of his disappointments could compare with one of life’s greatest tragedies, the loss of a young child. Jeb and I were too young to remember the pain and agony he and Mom felt when our 3-year-old sister died. We only learned later that Dad, a man of quiet faith, prayed for her daily. He was sustained by the love of the Almighty and the real and enduring love of her mom. Dad always believed that one day he would hug his precious Robin again.”“He married his sweetheart”Every day of his 73 years of marriage, Dad taught us all what it means to be a great husband. He married his sweetheart. He adored her. He laughed and cried with her. He was dedicated to her totally. In his old age, Dad enjoyed watching police show reruns, the volume on high, all the while holding Mom’s hand. After Mom died, Dad was strong, but all he really wanted to do was hold Mom’s hand again. Of course Dad taught me another special lesson: He showed me what it means to be a president who serves with integrity, leads with courage and acts with love in his heart for the citizens of our country.When the history books are written, they will say that George H.W. Bush was a great president of the United States, a diplomat of unmatched skill, a commander in chief of formidable accomplishment, and a gentleman who executed the duties of his office with dignity and honor. In his inaugural address, the 41st president of the United States said this: “We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account, we must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better than he found it.”What do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there—that we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us, or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship?Well, Dad, we’re going to remember you for exactly that and much more, and we’re going to miss you. Your decency, sincerity, and kind soul will stay with us forever.So through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you, a great and noble man, the best father a son or daughter could have. And in our grief, let us smile knowing that Dad is hugging Robin and holding Mom’s hand again.",fake

416,05-Dec-18,"According to the Daily Caller, the Weekly Standard is not expected to survive going into 2019 and is preparing to shut down permanently, according to a current staff member and former member of the magazine’s parent company who spoke to The Daily Caller News Foundation.Rumors were circulating throughout the media class Tuesday about the fate of The Weekly Standard in the wake of the magazine’s dwindling readership and circulation, despite a rebranding effort as the preeminent right-leaning periodical for conservatives opposed to President Donald Trump.“I don’t expect it to exist after December 14, 2018,” one editor at the magazine told TheDCNF. “There is no budget for it AT ALL.”News broke Tuesday afternoon from CNN that the magazine’s editor-in-chief Stephen Hayes addressed staff about the magazine’s troubles, but did not go into detail about what the future might hold.The Weekly Standard was founded in 1995 by Bill Kristol and Fred Barnes. Originally owned by NewsCorp, the magazine was eventually sold in 2009 to billionaire Philip Anschutz. Individuals close to the magazine told TheDCNF that Anschutz was growing frustrated with the direction of the magazine.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]A former employee of The Washington Examiner, which is a member of the same parent company as The Weekly Standard, told TheDCNF the office had been hearing murmurings Monday about the magazine’s fate. That employee told TheDCNF there had been talk that some of The Weekly Standard would be folded into The Washington Examiner.During an interview with CNBC, Weekly Standard’s editor, Bill Kristol told CNBC that the re-election of President Barack Obama drove Fox News and its viewers around the bend, although he’s unsure whether the network led the way or followed its audience.Kristol, in his efforts to trash Fox News after he was fired from the top-rated network, accused Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who once worked for the unhinged Kristol at the Weekly Standard, of being a racist, then quickly backtracked, in an attempt to cover his tracks.“He had always a little touch of Pat Buchananism, I would say, paleoconservatism, but that’s very different from what he’s become now,” he said. “I mean, it is close now to racism, white — I mean, I don’t know if it’s racism exactly — but ethnonationalism of some kind, let’s call it. A combination of dumbing down, as you said earlier, and stirring people’s emotions in a very unhealthy way.”The Weekly Standard’s Editor-In-Chief, Stephen Hayes, has been so caught up in his arrogance, and bubble of hate for our President, that he probably doesn’t even recognize why his readers abandoned him. In one of his most recent rants about Trump, the unhinged editor-in-chief of the Weekly Standard wrote a piece about President Trump and phony Russian collusion scandal, that could have just as easily been written by Joy Behar of “The View.”While there is much that remains unclear about Donald Trump and Russia, what we do know is deeply troubling. Trump lied repeatedly about his dealings with a hostile adversary while that hostile adversary worked to get him elected president. Trump has for years gone out of his way to excuse Vladimir Putin’s misdeeds. On more than one occasion, Trump has publicly sided with the anti-American authoritarian over the U.S. intelligence community.Why has Trump behaved this way? We don’t know. He lies all the time, about matters large and small. And then, when he’s caught, he simply pretends that he hadn’t lied in the first place.

Director in charge of all counterintelligence operations.  Priestap was FBI Agent Peter Strzok’s boss; he was also at the epicenter of the story surrounding every action taken by the FBI in the Clinton investigation and the Trump campaign investigation.Bill Priestap was copied on every email of consequence including the writing of the Clinton exoneration talking points delivered by FBI Director James Comey.  Priestap was the central figure on the FBI side of both Clinton and Trump operations.  “Bill” is mentioned in hundreds of text messages sent by Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.In short, Bill Priestap was everywhere – except where you would most likely expect to find him, in media discussion.  The timing seems curious though the Wall Street Journal goes to great lengths to describe the timing as a mere happenstance due to his 20-year service anniversary and the opportunity to retire with full benefits. – Conservative TreehouseTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The Hill claims his departure is unrelated to the 2016 investigations and the questions that have been raised about them, the Journal reported.The FBI said in a statement to the newspaper that Priestap “became eligible to retire and has chosen to do so after 20 years of service.”Priestap was involved in the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Russians colluded with the Trump campaign, and he was also part of the bureau’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of State.When Priestap leaves the FBI, there will be no high-ranking officials who were involved in both investigations left at the bureau, according to the Journal.Conservative Treehouse – Priestap was so important that during FBI Director James Comey’s March 20th, 2017, congressional testimony Director Comey told Congress it was Bill Priestap who recommended that congressional oversight should not be notified of the ongoing counterintelligence operations.  Priestap’s instruction was so important that despite the rules violation FBI Director Comey followed his recommendation and kept Congress in the dark.Hmmm…is anyone in the mainstream media keeping track of the key players in the deep state?On the home-front: FBI Director of Counterintelligence Bill Priestap is married to Sabina Menshell a self-employed “consultant” with a history of donations to Democrat candidates, specifically to Hillary Clinton.Bill’s wife Sabina comes from a Goldman Sach’s connected family, which must be why Bill and Sabina can afford to live in a $3.2 million home in Washington DC.Preistap’s full government benefits should come in handy, as well.",fake

If she hadn’t had a weapon there’s no telling what would have happened,” the sheriff said. “I gave her a big hug. I told her how proud I was of her.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Clark said the incident was “a shining example” of why owning and knowing how to properly use a gun is important.McLaughlin had been in and out of the county jail roughly a dozen times on charges ranging from drug possession to assaulting a police officer to shoplifting, officials said.

419,04-Dec-18,"Last March, while appearing on Fox News’ Laura Ingraham show, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) explained the “deep state”, and how it accurately describes how an unelected bureaucracy of national security officials in positions of power exert influence without Congressional oversight.Absolutely, there is a deep state, because the deep state is the intelligence agencies that do not have oversight,” he said.“Only eight people in Congress know what they’re doing, and traditionally, those eight people have been a rubber stamp to let the intelligence communities do whatever they want. There is no skeptic among the eight people that are supposedly overseeing the intelligence community.”Again, today, during an interview, Senator Paul ripped into the “Deep State”, blasting them for exerting power over Congress and keeping information from him regarding the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Paul was discussing the highly anticipated Senate testimony of CIA Director Gina Haspel on “America’s Newsroom” Tuesday and said he and other lawmakers are being kept in the dark by intelligence agencies.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“To my mind, this is the very definition of the deep state,” Paul said.Watch:Senator Rand Paul Demands Briefing from CIA DirectorDo you want to know what the deep state is?

And today there’s yet another briefing and I’m being excluded.

He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2018Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, points out that the Mueller witch hunt’s latest plea deal with Cohen is only an attempt by the special prosecutor to embarrass President Trump with a business deal that never happened, claiming, “Mueller seems desperate to confuse Americans by conflating the canceled and legitimate Russia business venture with the Russia collusion theory he was actually hired to investigate. This is a transparent attempt to try to embarrass the president.”Cohen pleaded guilty last week to making false statements in 2017 to the Senate intelligence committee about the Trump Organization’s failed efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Discussions about the so-called Moscow Project continued five months longer in 2016 than Cohen had initially stated under oath.The nine-page charging document filed with the plea deal suggests that the special counsel is using the Moscow tower talks to connect Trump to Russia. But congressional investigators with House and Senate committees leading inquiries on the Russia question told RealClearInvestigations that it looks like Mueller withheld from the court details that would exonerate the president. They made this assessment in light of the charging document, known as a statement of “criminal information” (filed in lieu of an indictment when a defendant agrees to plead guilty); a fuller accounting of Cohen’s emails and text messages that Capitol Hill sources have seen; and the still-secret transcripts of closed-door testimony provided by a business associate of Cohen.On page 7 of the statement of criminal information filed against Cohen, which is separate from but related to the plea agreement, Mueller mentions that Cohen tried to email Russian President Vladimir Putin’s office on Jan. 14, 2016, and again on Jan. 16, 2016. But Mueller, who personally signed the document, omitted the fact that Cohen did not have any direct points of contact at the Kremlin, and had resorted to sending the emails to a general press mailbox. Sources who have seen these additional emails point out that this omitted information undercuts the idea of a “back channel” and thus the special counsel’s collusion case.Page 2 of the same criminal information document holds additional exculpatory evidence for Trump, sources say. It quotes an August 2017 letter from Cohen to the Senate intelligence committee in which he states that Trump “was never in contact with anyone about this [Moscow Project] proposal other than me.” This section of Cohen’s written testimony, unlike other parts, is not disputed as false by Mueller, which sources say means prosecutors have tested its veracity through corroborating sources and found it to be accurate.“Though Cohen may have lied to Congress about the dates,” one Hill investigator said, “it’s clear from personal messages he sent in 2015 and 2016 that the Trump Organization did not have formal lines of communication set up with Putin’s office or the Kremlin during the campaign. There was no secret ‘back channel.’” (For the rest of the Real Clear Politics article, go here.)The thread starts out by asking if Mueller can still be trusted?Big question is: Can Mueller still be trusted to continue to Investigate the President of the United States, after he withheld important information from the court, that showed further evidence of no collusion between Trump Campaign and Russia.

First, special counsel Robert Mueller will never be able to untangle the tangled webs with any credibility and needs to step aside.Mueller, whose office is apparently leaking the “secret” news that a grand jury has approved charges against an unidentified defendant, assumed his role with one big conflict, his relationship with his successor at the FBI, James Comey. That conflict has morphed into several more that are fixable only by resignation.That became obvious last week when events showed that any honest probe must examine the Obama White House and Justice Department. Mueller served as head of the FBI for more than four years under President Barack Obama and cannot be expected to investigate his former colleagues and bosses.But without that necessary step, his work would be incomplete at best.

Now the figure is closer to 800.First, it was costs associated with the repeated regulations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Then, after 1994 and the passing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) it was cheaper competition from places such as Mexico. In the end, there was no way Weirton could compete, and an industry that has fed and clothed the city for generations essentially died.“Her husband introduced Nafta,” said a former steel worker, sitting at the the bar of the Columbia Club, located at one was once Gate No 1 of the Weirton Steel Corporation’s main factory. He had worked at the plant for 34 years. “If anyone in this in this state votes for her, they’re crazy.”It is communities such as this that Donald Trump has been targeting hard with his pitch about the evils of Nafta and the need to bring jobs – well-paid manufacturing jobs in particular – back to America.

426,02-Dec-18,"Even though it’s a mostly blue state, there are still a few Republican strongholds in California. Orange County used to be considered one of those stronghold districts. They were still considered a Republican district until several days after the election, when thousands of votes came in, and helped the Democrats to flip red seats blue.What should Republicans make of this 11th hour blow out of Republicans by Democrat candidates, many of them who are were virtually unknown before the midterm elections? With a massive number of Democrat votes coming in weeks after the actual election, how are Republicans going to guarantee that we never see this kind of election happen again?In the 21st District of California (a Central Valley district carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016), incumbent congressman David Valadao was called as the winner by the Associated Press on election night; he had a solid 4,000-plus vote lead, and was never considered a likely loser during the campaign (his race was rated a noncompetitive Likely Republican by the Cook Political Report). But late ballots, mostly from votes-by-mail that met the state’s condition of having been postmarked by Election Day, steadily eroded Valadao’s lead (as it did the votes of most GOP statewide and congressional candidates in California in the days following the election), and ultimately gave Democrat TJ Cox the victory, as called today by the Los Angeles Times. It means Democrats flipped a remarkable seven House seats in California this year, and it brought the Democratic Party’s total net gains to a nice even 40 seats (they flipped 43 seats and lost three of their own). – IntelligencerThe Daily Caller reports – As the polls closed on election day last month, six California Republican House candidates, including Representatives Dana Rohrabacher, Steve Knight, and Mimi Walters, were ahead in their respective races. However, as the absentee and provisional ballots rolled in over the intervening weeks, all six lost to their Democratic opponents.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The case of Korean-American GOP candidate Young Kim was one of the most prominent examples. On election night, Kim held an 8,000 vote lead over her Democratic opponent Gil Cisneros, and even attended freshman orientation in Washington, D.C. before watching her lead, and her victory, slowly evaporate over the subsequent weeks.“California just defies logic to me,” said Ryan at a Washington Post live event. “We were only down 26 seats the night of the election, and three weeks later, we lost basically every California contested race. This election system they have — I can’t begin to understand what ‘ballot harvesting’ is.”The stunning turnaround in California, of all states, can be attributed to several factors, as conservative critics like The Federalist’s Bre Payton wrote, but the most significant of those seemed to be the practice of “ballot harvesting.”Few people noticed when Gov. Jerry Brown signed the changes in AB1921 into law two years ago. In the past, California allowed only relatives or people living in the same household to drop off mail ballots for another voter. The new law allowed anyone, even a paid political campaign worker, to collect and return ballots — “harvesting” them, in political slang.One of the lessons that the GOP needs to learn out of this election cycle is how to work within all of the new rules, same-day voter registration, motor voters,” Denham said. “There have been a lot of changes in laws that I think have caught many in the Republican Party by surprise. You can’t just run a traditional campaign as you did before.”San Fransisco Chronicle reports – In Orange County alone, where every House seat went Democratic, “the number of Election Day vote-by-mail dropoffs was unprecedented — over 250,000,” Fred Whitaker, chairman of the county Republican Party, said in a note to supporters. “This is a direct result of ballot harvesting allowed under California law for the first time. That directly caused the switch from being ahead on election night to losing two weeks later.”Watch what happens when a video produced by a homeowner’s ring.com service shows a Democrat operative offering to take a voter’s ballot from them to be counted.The woman in the video, who identifies herself only as “Lulu” says it’s a “new service,” said Lulu, for “like, people who are supporting the Democratic party.”Some Republicans have cast a skeptical eye on Democrats’ use of “ballot harvesting” to boost their support. The idea’s backers say it’s just one of several steps California has taken to enable more people to vote.Across the state there were reports of groups collecting ballots and dropping them off at polling places and election offices.“We certainly had that going on here, with people dropping off maybe 100 or 200 ballots,” said Neal Kelley, Orange County’s registrar of voters. “We also had voters calling and asking if it was legitimate for someone to come to their door and ask if they could take their ballot” and deliver it to the polls.For Democrats, the ballot harvesting was all part of a greater effort to get out the vote from their supporters, particularly from occasional voters.“We beat Republicans on the ground, fair and square,” said Katie Merrill, a Democratic consultant deeply involved in November campaigns. “Many of the field plans included (ballot harvesting) as an option to deliver voters or their ballots” to the polls.Those efforts involved identifying voters who might support Democratic candidates and ignoring those who wouldn’t.In one Orange County household, for example, both the husband and wife were longtime Republicans, said Dale Neugebauer, a veteran Republican consultant. Democratic volunteers came by the house four times, each time asking to speak only with their 18-year-old daughter, a no-party-preference voter, and asking if she wanted them to pick up her signed and completed ballot.That’s a perfect example of the “thorough and disciplined” ground game the Democrats used, said Merrill.“We were not wasting time talking to people who weren’t going to vote for Democrats,” she said.    ",fake
427,02-Dec-18,"You know it’s time to get the hook when leftist journalists like Maureen Dowd of the New York Times jumps ship.We could feel it coming when Democrats poo-pooed the last-ditch effort Hillary Clinton made to remotely suggest she would run in 2020. The Democrats couldn’t move fast enough to denounce any speculation of that happening. In other words, the thrill is gone. The Clintons are no longer of any use to the Party.If only they could see it like so many others do…The fading glory of politicians like the Clintons looks harsher when they refuse to gracefully go back into private life. Sure, they’ll make an appearance on CNN once in a while…but a tour?Check out Maureen Dowd’s take on the uncomfortable fading glory of Bill and Hill…Maureen Down of the New York Times:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The snow is falling lightly.My thoughts are racing darkly.I’m feeling something foreign, something I’ve never felt before. It takes me a moment to identify it.I’m feeling sorry for the Clintons.In the 27 years I’ve covered Bill and Hillary, I’ve experienced a range of emotions. They’ve dazzled me and they’ve disgusted me.But now they’re mystifying me.I’m looking around Scotiabank Arena, the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and it’s a depressing sight. It’s two-for-the-price-of-one in half the arena. The hockey rink is half curtained off, but even with that, organizers are scrambling at the last minute to cordon off more sections behind thick black curtains, they say due to a lack of sales. I paid $177 weeks in advance. (I passed on the pricey meet-and-greet option.) On the day of the event, some unsold tickets are slashed to single digits.I get reassigned to another section as the Clintons’ audience space shrinks. But even with all the herding, I’m still looking at large swaths of empty seats — and I cringe at the thought that the Clintons will look out and see that, too. It was only four years ago, after all, that Canadians were clamoring to buy tickets to see the woman who seemed headed for history.It’s a sad contrast with the sold-out boffo book tour of Michelle Obama, who’s getting a lot more personal for the premium prices. But introspection has never been within the Clintons’ range.I can’t fathom why the Clintons would make like aging rock stars and go on a tour of Canada and the U.S. at a moment when Democrats are hoping to break the stranglehold of their cloistered, superannuated leadership and exult in a mosaic of exciting new faces.What is the point? It’s not inspirational. It’s not for charity. They’re not raising awareness about a cause, like Al Gore with global warming. They’re only raising awareness about the Clintons.It can’t be the money at this point. Have they even spent all the Goldman gold yet? Do they want to swim in their cash like Scrooge McDuck?The Clintons’ tin cup is worthy of the Smithsonian. They hoovered more than $2 billion in contributions to their campaigns, foundation and philanthropies.Keep reading…",fake
428,02-Dec-18,"Townhall is reporting that Khaghossi was not, in fact, a green card holder in the US, as previously reported.According to a report in Business Insider, Khashoggi simply visited the U.S. on a visa.Mohamad Soltan, an Egyptian-American activist who sees Khashoggi regularly in Washington, told Reuters that Khashoggi was in the United States on an O-visa, a temporary residency visa awarded to foreigners “who possess extraordinary ability” in the sciences, arts, education, and other fields and are recognized internationally, and had applied for permanent residency status.The book was adapted for television as a series with the same title and tells the story of Al-Qaeda’s infamous attacks on New York and Washington. In one paragraph, Wright mentions a close friend of Bin Laden’s who shared the latter’s ambition to “establish an Islamic state anywhere.” That friend was Jamal Khashoggi. Both Bin Laden and Khashoggi were at the time active members of the Muslim Brotherhood and later Bin Laden would split from the Brotherhood to form with Abdullah Azzam Al-Qaeda, the most dangerous organization in the world. Khashoggi, Bin Laden, and Azzam were all the merry companions of the same extremist group.Today, the world is busy keeping up with the news of the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, journalist and Human Rights activist in Saudi Arabia, but very few know the man’s past and his affiliation with Al-Qaeda during the war in Afghanistan. He promoted Saudi Mujahedeen focusing on his friendship with Bin Laden.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]In his public writings, Jamal Khashoggi’s criticism of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was measured. In private, the Washington Post columnist didn’t hold back.In more than 400 WhatsApp messages sent to a fellow Saudi exile in the year before he was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Khashoggi describes bin Salman — often referred to as MBS — as a “beast,” a “pac-man” who would devour all in his path, even his supporters.CNN was granted exclusive access to the correspondence between Khashoggi and Montreal-based activist Omar Abdulaziz. The messages shared by Abdulaziz, which include voice recordings, photos and videos, paint a picture of a man deeply troubled by what he regarded as the petulance of his kingdom’s powerful young prince.“The more victims he eats, the more he wants,” says Khashoggi in one message sent in May, just after a group of Saudi activists had been rounded up. “I will not be surprised if the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him on.”The exchanges reveal a progression from talk to action — the pair had begun planning an online youth movement that would hold the Saudi state to account. “[Jamal] believed that MBS is the issue, is the problem and he said this kid should be stopped,” Abdulaziz said in an interview with CNN.But in August, when he believed their conversations may have been intercepted by Saudi authorities, a sense of foreboding descends over Khashoggi. “God help us,” he wrote.Two months later, he was dead.Abdulaziz on Sunday launched a lawsuit against an Israeli company that invented the software he believes was used to hack his phone.“The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,” Abdelaziz told CNN. “The guilt is killing me.”Abdulaziz began speaking out against the Saudi regime as a college student in Canada. His pointed criticisms of government policies drew the attention of the Saudi state, which canceled his university scholarship. Canada granted him asylum in 2014 and made him a permanent resident three years later.In almost daily exchanges between October 2017 and August 2018, Khashoggi and Abdulaziz conceived plans to form an electronic army to engage young Saudis back home and debunk state propaganda on social media, leveraging Khashoggi’s establishment profile and the 27-year-old Abdulaziz’s 340,000-strong Twitter following.The digital offensive, dubbed the “cyber bees,” had emerged from earlier discussions about creating a portal for documenting human rights abuses in their homeland as well an initiative to produce short films for mobile distribution. “We have no parliament; we just have Twitter,” said Abdulaziz, adding that Twitter is also the Saudi’s government’s strongest weapon. “Twitter is the only tool they’re using to fight and to spread their rumors. We’ve been attacked, we’ve been insulted, we’d been threatened so many times, and we decided to do something.”The pair’s scheme involved two key elements that Saudi Arabia might well have viewed as hostile acts. The first involved sending foreign SIM cards to dissidents back home so they could tweet without being traced. The second was money. According to Abdulaziz, Khashoggi pledged an initial $30,000 and promised to drum up support from rich donors under the radar.But in early August, he says he received word from Saudi Arabia that government officials were aware of the pair’s online project. He passed the news to Khashoggi.“How did they know?” asks Khashoggi in a message.“There must have been a gap,” says Abdulaziz.Three minutes pass before Khashoggi writes back: “God help us.”The fact Abdulaziz’s phone contained spyware means Saudi officials would have been able to see the same 400 messages Abdulaziz exchanged with Khashoggi over the period.The messages portray Khashoggi, a Saudi former establishment figure, becoming increasingly fearful for his country’s fate as bin Salman consolidates his power.“He loves force, oppression and needs to show them off,” Khashoggi says of bin Salman, “but tyranny has no logic.”Such discussions could be considered treasonous in Saudi Arabia, a country with one of the world’s worst records for free speech.For the entire CNN story, go here. ",fake
429,01-Dec-18,"This is why we elected this amazingly strong president. President Trump was just the one sensible person in the room who hasn’t been blinded by the wildest, prolific political agenda of our generation. At least someone is resisting the pressure to back this unscientific, unprovable, preposterous supposition. Good for him. Maybe President Trump heard Rush Limbaugh call out the bogus report on climate change that just came out (see Limbaugh’s revealing report below).World leaders at the G-20 summit on Saturday signed a statement pledging support for the Paris climate agreement and a promise to reform the WTO. All of the leaders EXCEPT President Trump signed the climate change statement!The statement calls for reforming the World Trade Organization and also says that the 19 leaders, excluding President Trump, commit to fighting climate change through the Paris agreement.President Trump has objected to the previously agreed upon Paris agreement since he took office. He has called out the Obama administration for this bad deal.We love that he didn’t cave while all of the other world leaders did. We’re sure Al Gore is livid…LOL!Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO] MAGA!The argument the left has been using to support climate change is the report recently released by the government. The problem is that the report by an Obama administration crony who’s still working in the administration. Rush Limbaugh busted this scam wide open on his show revealing that the so-called “scientist” is NOT a scientist.It’s too bad our media is so in-the-bag for the left, otherwise, they would have uncovered this important detail about the climate change report.RUSH LIMBAUGH ON THE “CACA” REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE:RUSH: So I’m watching CNN this morning, I have it on, all of a sudden I look up and I see Christine Todd Whitman. Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey and quintessential Republican establishment type, RINO, if you will, right out of the McCain wing of the party. You know what she’s talking about? The need for serious climate change action.She’s quoting from the Trump administration climate change report which, for about the gazillionth time now in the last 30 years, warns us that we only have 10 years left to address these dire circumstances or else by the end of the century, 82 years from now, we’re gonna die. We have 10 years. And, if we don’t do what these people say needs to be done in 10 years, then in another 82 years, we are gonna die.I looked at that just on the surface of it. How do we even have a chance when brain-dead RINOs even fall for this stuff? And, by the way, I mean brain-dead falling for it. It could well be that they’re just their own version of pro-government, leftist-type activists and sign on to it just because the government says so. But I also wonder how many people on our side who buy into this stuff really just don’t know, they just accept it because they think the sources are credible?Well, it turns out — and of course one of the selling points in this latest climate report, “Well, it came from Trump’s own administration!” And the media’s loving running around saying that Trump’s saying I just don’t believe it. “Well, what do you mean? Your own administration put out the report.” And Trump said (paraphrasing), “I didn’t put out the report. It may have come from people who work in Washington, but they’re not part of my operation. I did not put out the report. I do not believe it.”Then they start mocking him and making fun of him as being a full-fledged idiot. And if you’re just patient, if people are just patient and we eventually will find out, “Andrew Light, who worked on the 2015 Paris accord negotiations as a senior adviser to the U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Change under Secretary of State John F. Kerry, served as a review editor for the assessment –” In other words, an Obamaite wrote this climate report in the Trump administration.“Andrew Light, who worked on the 2015 Paris accord negotiations as a senior adviser to the U.S. Special Envoy on Climate Change under Secretary of State John F. Kerry, served as a review editor for the assessment, overseeing the pivotal final chapter that concluded under a worst-case scenario that global warming could wipe out as much as 10 percent of the U.S. economy by 2100.”“Mr. Light also spent five years as senior fellow and director of international climate policy at the Center for American Progress, which was founded and now led by longtime Democratic insider [and phishing victim] John Podesta. The center is also financed by liberal billionaires such as Mr. Soros and Mr. Steyer.”So this Trump administration, like any other, has career appointees. The left gets themselves appointed to these career positions, they never leave, and they serve to corrupt. Even though we have a new president from a New Party, Obamaites still populate much of Washington in the bureaucracies and in the cabinet level departments and so forth, like FDA, EPA. I mean they’re all over the place, just like the left appoints judges who are left-wing activists, not really judges, and they are there to provide election loss insurance.And so here we basically have somebody that worked for John Kerry and this phony special envoy on climate change who had the final review of the Trump administration National Climate Assessment.",fake
430,01-Dec-18,"According to the Washington Times, violence against Border Patrol agents continued to spiral this week with authorities reporting one agent held at gunpoint by an illegal immigrant in California, and two agents in Arizona facing attacks by hand.In the California incident agents responded Monday morning to a report that two illegal immigrants had been detected crossing the border on foot. The first man was apprehended without any problem, but the second, Hector Rodriguez-Chavez, aimed a loaded Star Echeverria pistol at an agent.The agent and Rodriguez struggled for the gun, and even the help of two other agents was not enough to pry the weapon from Rodriguez’s hand, the agents said in court documents.Finally, one of the agents used his taser on Rodriguez, who dropped the pistol and stopped resisting.Agents later found that he’d been deported back to Mexico at least five times before, dating back more than 20 years. His most recent ouster was in October 2017. He also had convictions in the U.S. for violent drug crimes and firearms offenses.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The Arizona assaults both happened Tuesday.In one, agents were trying to arrest four illegal immigrants when one of them, a 25-year-old Guatemalan man, threw dirt in an agent’s face then swung his belt, trying to use the buckle as a weapon to strike the agent.He was subdued and put into a vehicle, where he then spit in another agent’s face, authorities said.Hours later another Guatemalan man, who’d previously been deported, was caught sneaking back in by an agent and his canine.The 36-year-old man started striking the agent, but he was eventually subdued. Authorities said they discovered he’d been deported just six months ago.This video taken at the Tijuana, Mexico border where the massive mob of illegal aliens are squatting, shows the mostly male group lobbing rocks at US Border agents on the other side of the fence.

431,01-Dec-18,"A landlord who owns the apartment where a Harvard grad student and six of her roommates live, is punishing her for being a legal gun owner.Her six roommates targeted Leyla Pirnie for owning a Make America Great Again hat and living in a red state. Is there anyone less tolerant than a liberal?A Massachusetts landlord told a Harvard University graduate student that he wanted her to move out of her apartment because her legally owned firearms made some of her roommates uncomfortable.“Since it’s clear that Leyla wants to keep her firearms, it would be best for all parties if she finds another place to live,” Dave Lewis, president of Avid Management, said in an email to the household obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.The request that the student, Leyla Pirnie, move out came after her roommates searched her room while she was not home and found her firearms. That prompted one of the roommates to email Lewis requesting he verify that Pirnie was in compliance with applicable firearms laws.“We discussed with Leyla that all of us are uncomfortable with having firearms in the house, and that their presence causes anxiety and deprives us of the quiet enjoyment of the premise to which we are entitled,” the roommate wrote to Lewis.Pirnie said she feels her roommates violated her privacy and now they and her landlord are trying to violate her rights.“A few weeks ago, I came back to my apartment from a weekend trip and was confronted by one of my roommates who asked if I had guns in the house,” she told the Free Beacon. “After being told far too many lies to count, my roommates finally admitted that they searched my closet, under my bed, and all of my drawers in pursuit of finding my guns.”While she was given several different explanations for why the roommates entered and searched her room, the 24-year-old said she felt her political beliefs and where she is from played a significant role in the roommates’ actions.“When I asked them why they were in my room, to begin with, they each came up with completely contradicting stories (none of which made any sense), but one comment struck me in particular: ‘We saw that you had a MAGA hat and come on, you’re from Alabama… so we just kind of assumed that you had something,'” she said. “I asked why they didn’t just call me and ask me before intruding. One of the girls responded that fear took over her body and she felt compelled to search my room until she found proof… I cannot make this up.”Pirnie said she had been living in the apartment since September without incident, and she kept her political beliefs to herself before the incident. But she did have a Make America Great Again hat in her room. –WFB Pirnie agreed to allow the Somerville Police Department to inspect her firearms. The police department said she had not broken any laws and that she was in compliance with the law.

They also asserted Cohen orchestrated illegal campaign contributions in the form of payments to alleged Trump mistresses in order to protect the former real estate mogul.The thrust of Cohen’s argument for leniency is his extensive cooperation in the “unique” circumstances in which the special counsel’s investigation is operating.Cohen’s lawyers, Guy Petrillo, and Amy Lester, asserted Cohen’s cooperation helped legitimize an investigation that is under constant attack by Trump. They also argue Cohen is cooperating even though Trump reportedly suggested in private he is willing to pardon associates ensnared in the special counsel’s probe. –Daily Caller",fake

435,30-Nov-18,"It started out as a normal day on “The View”—Dingbat #1 (Whoopi Goldberg) was missing so Dingbat #2 (Joy Behar) was filling in as the show’s moderator. Behaving as a moderator is usually a relatively easy task for an unhinged liberal like Joy Behar, who sits at the head of a table that is usually filled with 3-4 angry liberal women, and an audience who claps like trained seals everytime they trash President Trump or his family. Today, however, was a different story. When the uninformed liberals began spewing misinformation about President Trump and how he treats Russian President Vladimir Putin, the relatively new co-host, Abby Huntsman, whose father is Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah and current Ambassador of the United States to Russia, wasn’t about to sit back and let them spew lies about President Trump.Dingbat #2, Joy Behar, started out by gloating about how yesterday it was revealed by Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen in a plea deal that Putin was offered a $50 million penthouse at a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow. (Never mind, that Trump never offered Putin a penthouse. The FACTS are, that unnamed people within the Trump organization bantered the idea around of offering a penthouse to Putin, as a way to entice wealthy Russians to purchase a unit in the proposed Trump Tower)Behar asked, “Could this be why Trump is canceling his meeitng with PUtin at the G20 Summit? He doesn’t like the optics of being seen with Putin?”Leftist co-host Anna Navara agreed that the cancellation of Trump’s meeting with Putin at the G20 Summit was “all about optics”, citing that he had “alone time” with Putin in Helsinki a couple of months ago.That’s when the newest member of The View panel, Abby Huntsman, jumped in and stopped the uninformed, angry liberal women in their tracks.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“I think if you look at the substance of the policy under the Trump administration when you’re dealing with Putin in Russia, you could argue that they’ve been tougher than any administration since the Cold War.”“You can talk about the optics, you can talk about his tweets which I actually hated that he tweeted canceling this meeting because that’s not how you handle diplomacy. But no one ever talks about the actual issues and what’s being done to combat Russia because that’s not the shiny object, no one cares about that,”“No one gives the president credit for anything that he does right.”Co-host Sunny Hostin, who is perpetually angry, and frequently leaves her viewers wondering how she gets away with spewing so much misinformation, asks: “Why was the meeting canceled?” co-host Sunny Hostin said, referring to President Trump canceling his scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Hostin continued with her misinformation campaign, attempting to drag Trump’s children into the fake scandal: “It just strikes me as odd that Michael Cohen, this bombshell gets dropped about not how only Trump was involved with Russia and building this tower, his children were also notified about it and Ivanka is part of that as well,” she said.“Now he is saying the reason — I’m sorry, the meeting with the spy, and there’s also a building of the Tower in Moscow— but now he’s saying the reason he’s not meeting with Putin is because he’s upset because they haven’t returned the navy sailors to the Ukraine. Um—when was he concerned about the Ukraine?”That’s when Huntsman lost it:“Really, Sunny? Really, Sunny?”“Trump has actually been tougher on Ukraine than President Obama was.

Immigration, therefore, must be approached carefully and cautiously.” – Thomas JeffersonTASK FORCE ON NEW AMERICANS FOR A NEW AMERICA: How Obama’s administration weaponized illegal aliens and refugeesJournalist and radio host Sue Payne reveals to Mark Levin what we’ve been saying about what’s happening to small towns all across America. Ms. Payne was lucky enough to be privy to a  plan for building a ‘country within a country’ using illegals and refugees. This is terrible for America and is a serious blow to our economy, jobs and way of life. Please listen to Sue Payne and read the bullet points below. Google “Welcoming America” and check to see if they’re in your town, then you’ll know if your town is a target. Yes, this is the fundamental transformation Obama was talking about.Sue Payne was privy to listening-in on multiple conference calls between Barack Obama and 16 members of his cabinet. What she uncovered was shocking and disturbing.The administration’s weaponization of illegal aliens and refugees may be far more sinister than even the most ardent opponents have yet imagined.On one of these calls, Obama conducted a meeting with his new ‘Task Force On New Americans,’ chaired by radical Cecilia Munoz, former vice president of the radical, Hispanic race-supremacy group La Raza (‘The Race’).
MARK LEVIN INTERVIEWS SUE PAYNE:
﻿
“Remember when he (Obama) went to Las Vegas? The media said he was signing an executive order for five million illegal aliens to become deferred. In reality, what he did was sign a memorandum that created the ‘Task Force On New Americans,’ which was going to implement his ‘amnesty mill’ for the five million illegals – which I believe is going to be more than that… On these conference calls, it became clear that he’s looking at 13 to 15 million to give protection and move them on to citizenship.” – PayneThese initial “new Americans” are to be used as “seedlings” in the construction of a “country within a country,” which would help complete a full ‘fundamental transformation’ of the United States.Specific cities are being designated as “receiving communities” (sanctuary cities – we now have 300!) to which illegals are being bused and flown at the expense of American taxpayers. These communities are being used as incubators for an entirely new population that assist in bringing ‘people in the shadows’ into the light – to essentially conquer proper citizens and push them into the underclasses over time.SHELBYVILLE IS A “RECEIVING COMMUNITY”
﻿Cabinet members discussed the importance of designating upon these illegals ‘refugee status,’ and to then make them aware of their ‘rights’ as they pertain to massive income tax credits (to the tune of $35,000 in some cases), free medical care, free in-state tuition, 0% personal loans, credit cards, and other forms of ‘free cash’ – all at taxpayer expense.Additionally, there was emphasis placed on the importance of waves of older illegal immigrants “aging successfully” by being immediately slip-streamed into the Social Security program that the Congressional Budget Office has already warned will be completely exhausted by 2030. This is, of course, despite the fact that they would be illegally and undeservedly sucking dry the mandatory lifetime contributions of American workers.It was also made clear that this ‘protected class’ of illegal aliens from South and Central America, Mexico, Haiti, Syria, Africa, and the Middle East would not be interested in – nor expected to be – integrating, but to instead “navigate” their way through our society and culture until theirs’ dominate. Read more: wfpOn November 21, 2014 the Task Force on New Americans was formed. Task Force began meeting until Jan – Feb 2015, when a series of three (3) listening sessions was conducted to gather information for the preparation of a report due to the president by March 2015.During the three listening sessions, it was disclosed that representatives of the White House and all cabinet members as well as immigrant groups would share information to be included in the report.
Some of the information exchanged was:Immigrants should be viewed as seedlings to be planted in fertile soil to grow. The fertile soil was equated to the “receiving communities” which would be those communities the illegal aliens are now living in, but once out of the shadows, these communities become welcoming or receiving communities.Others commented that these same communities would be viewed as “emergent immigrant communities”As a listener on the call, it was easy to logically see how these communities would welcome immigrants out of the shadows, but also, it could be construed that the host community members might well be relegated into the shadows. In essence, the seedlings consume the host and what was once the original community is transformed.One comment cautioned against assuming these “New Americans” would want to assimilate. The interest was in navigation, not assimilation, and the navigation was through the system, focused on benefits.Another commented that not all the New Americans would want work permits; rather many of the immigrant women wanted to be home with their children and not work, provided taxpayer benefits are secured for them and their children.*Another suggestion indicated that the Task Force consider these New Americans as refugees or asylum seekers, and as such considered for cash, medical, educational, and housing benefits.*Testimony by John Conyers  reveals that the effort to rename and therefore reclassify illegals as refugees is happening:

437,30-Nov-18,"Between 2010 and 2016, the number of Muslims living in Germany rose from 3.3 million (4.1% of the population) to nearly 5 million (6.1%), while the rest of the population shrank modestly from 77.1 million to 76.5 million. Immigration has been a major factor in the growth of Germany’s Muslim population. But, even if there is no more immigration, Muslims will continue to increase as a share of Germany’s population in future decades because German Muslims, on average, are much younger and have more babies than Germans as a whole.If you live or work in Hamburg, Germany, the nation’s second largest city with a population of 1.8 million, you can be treated to an ear-piercing loudspeaker blasting Muslim prayers from the top of a church five times per day. While Christianity is the most widely practiced religion in Germany (about 58% of German’s identify as Christians), the majority of citizens in Hamburg identify as atheists or agnostics.Breitbart reports – At certain times each day between December 2nd and 23rd, people strolling through the centre of Linz will be treated to “a special kind of audiovisual experience,” when recordings of muezzin calls, which were taped in Algeria, Mozambique, Istanbul, and Singapore, are played from the chapel of the Upper Austrian Cultural Quarter’s Ursuline Church.The organisers behind ‘ADHINA’ say the installation “succeeds in linking the aesthetics of different realms of reality,” when visitors hear “the muezzin call as an Islamic ritual” melding together with “the everyday sounds of a secular-urban world,”, as they walk past the “Christian sacral architecture” at the site, where the baroque buildings were founded as a monastery.Watch:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Without any more migration, Germany’s aging population would be expected to decline by about 15% by 2050. But if recent migration patterns continue, its overall population is projected to hold steady or even increase by the middle of the 21st century, in large part due to the arrival of Muslim immigrants. These patterns are similar to trends across Europe (defined in our new report as the European Union plus Norway and Switzerland). As the most populous country and the biggest economy in the EU, Germany often sets the tone for policies among the EU’s 28 member states. Under the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany has opened its borders to large numbers of migrants, including many Muslim refugees seeking asylum from war and unrest in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. We’re gonna go out on a limb here, but this sounds more like indoctrination to Islam program for a city filled with atheists or agnostics than an “art project.” ",fake

Just before he was re-elected, former President Obama was caught on camera on Monday telling the outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have “more flexibility” to deal in his dealings with Russia after the next presidential election.Meanwhile…according to Fox News’ brilliant legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, Trump supporters can relax, because the latest plea deal that was cut with Michael Cohen, does nothing to implicate Trump in any wrongdoing as it relates to Russia.According to Fox News’ Gregg Jarrett– President Trump’s disgraced former personal lawyer Michael Cohen’s guilty plea to lying to Congress about a possible Trump Organization real estate project in Moscow that never materialized is not worth much – except to Cohen.Before his newest guilty plea Thursday, Cohen – already a confessed liar and criminal – pleaded guilty in August to violating campaign finance laws, multiple counts of tax evasion and bank fraud dealing with his personal finances.President Trump made the point to reporters after Cohen entered his latest guilty plea in U.S. District Court in New York City.“Michael Cohen is lying and he’s trying to get a reduced sentence for things that have nothing to do with me,” the president said. “This was a project (in Moscow) that we didn’t do, I didn’t do …. There would be nothing wrong if I did do it.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]President Trump laid it all out for the press on the White House lawn earlier today:WATCH: President Trump says his former attorney Michael Cohen is ""a weak person"" and ""not a very smart person,"" after Cohen pleaded guilty to making false statements https://t.co/vEE5vZwqpw pic.twitter.com/avuaV9mT0B— CBS News (@CBSNews) November 29, 2018Cohen’s plea is worth just enough to give Democrats and members of the Trump-hating media – who know little about the law – something to howl about. Beyond that, it’s of zero value in proving that the president and/or his campaign somehow conspired, coordinated or, if you prefer, “colluded” with Russia to influence the presidential election two years ago.And this alleged Trump-Russia collusion is, after all, what Mueller is supposed to be investigating. To date, there is no reason to believe that he has uncovered any incriminating evidence that would support his mandate.Still, the special counsel seems desperate to find something – anything – to show that his 18-months of probing, costing taxpayers millions of dollars, has not been big a waste of time and money.Granted, no one should lie to Congress, the FBI or prosecutors. But in the context of the Russia probe, making a false statement is a “process crime.” It has nothing whatsoever to do with establishing that Trump conspired with Russia to win the presidential election.Indeed, the admitted deception by Cohen in lying to Congress occurred after Trump took office and is only a product of Mueller’s own investigation. As law professor Alan Dershowitz pointed out on Fox News just after the plea was announced, the special counsel is “creating crimes or creating opportunities for crimes to be committed.”Thus, there are legitimate reasons to question the substance of the recent actions by the special counsel and whether they implicate, even tangentially, President Trump in any wrongdoing.Because Cohen is an admitted liar and tax cheat, we have to be skeptical about how honest he is being now. We can’t rule out the possibility that in exchange for lenient sentencing, Cohen may be lying about his lies.It is impossible to know from what’s on the public record, but Cohen clearly has every motivation to agree to whatever prosecutors want him to say. If they command that he trash President Trump to avoid serious prison time, Cohen is the kind of person who would surely do it. This makes whatever he says utterly devoid of credibility.No one, including prosecutors, can trust that what comes out of Cohen’s mouth bears any resemblance to the truth. In front of a jury, he’d be worthless. And that is the dilemma whenever the government gets in bed with crooks and liars.Amid the media hysteria over Cohen’s latest guilty plea, many journalists seem to have overlooked one important and immutable fact: absolutely nothing that he now says about the never-finalized Moscow real estate venture establishes an election conspiracy.As has been widely reported for two years, the Trump Organization scrapped its proposal to build a tower in Moscow and the deal never materialized. A failed deal hardly constitutes a quid pro quo for Russian help to win the presidency.It is not a crime to develop real estate in Russia, which makes it all the more mystifying why Cohen would lie about it. If some nefarious election “collusion” was involved, Cohen would certainly have been charged. This is how normal prosecutions unfold.  ",fake

447,28-Nov-18,"A Thanksgiving Day argument between two sons over NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem led to a father shooting one of his sons in the leg. The Cary, NC father was arrested and has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury in connection with the shooting.As usual the leftist media and bloggers went out of their way to encourage their anti-American comrades to stick it to conservatives this year at Thanksgiving. They warned their unhinged followers to not be afraid of  confrontation with family members, claiming it was actually their moral obligation to stir things up with their relatives.In a piece written by Amy McArthy titled: You’re Morally Obligated to Call Out Your Racist Relatives at Thanksgiving—The annual dinner is the perfect time for uncomfortable conversation, she suggests ignoring social norms and going after your relatives at the dinner table if they don’t conform to your views:There’s a real bystander effect that comes into play when someone at the Thanksgiving table begins ranting. At first, maybe you think the presence of a large group of people will prevent racial slurs from falling out of someone’s mouth, and then they do.Most of us are raised to unfailingly respect our elders, which creates a hierarchy of who is even allowed to “talk back” to our grandparents and aunts in general, much less at a table full of people.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Overcoming what you’ve been trained to do since birth takes a little bit of courage and a lot of hard work, bizarre family dynamics notwithstanding. (As a Southern progressive, I’ve learned that “no politics at the dinner table” really just means “keep your mouth shut and don’t upset your grandmama.”) But if you’re so disgusted by what you see in the news, you can’t just sit there and pretend that the people in your family didn’t play some role in getting to where we are today: If your family has a particularly conservative political bent, it’s unlikely that they’ll feel uncomfortable talking about the hypothetical harms of the caravan of migrants currently making their way across Mexico, or shy away from agreeing with Trump that certain people of color, like LeBron James and Maxine Waters, are “dumb.” For that temporary peace during dinner, you trade an opportunity to make a space you occupy safer for everyone. What’s actually happening here is that you’re being asked to overlook bigotry in favor of politeness, which is a classic modeling of the way that calls for civility are used to excuse this behavior and suppress pushback against it.For one Cary, NC family, the advise of Amy McArthy, who suggested it’s a moral obligation to confront relatives over Thanksgiving dinner could have caused the death of a son and possibly life behind bars for the father.According to CBS17– Witnesses told police that the victim had been drinking heavily throughout the day before the physical and verbal confrontation that led to the shooting occurred.Lamadrid told police that his family had just sat down to have Thanksgiving dinner when two of his sons got into an argument about athletes taking a knee during the national anthem, warrants show.The victim became confrontational with his older brother and it was at that point that Lamadrid told his 21-year-old son to leave the house. Soon after telling his son to leave the home, the confrontation between his two children became physical and he tried to step in, but was not strong enough to keep his sons separated, he told police.According to the warrants, once Lamadrid realized he couldn’t stop the confrontation and his youngest son wouldn’t leave the home, he went to get his shotgun. The man left the home and went to the backyard after seeing his father with a shotgun.One of Lamadrid’s other sons then started an argument with him saying that it was his fault the whole confrontation began, warrants show. He then asked that son to leave the house. His son complied and left.Once that son left, the victim came back into the house and continued to argue with his father before Lamadrid took his son’s bags and put them outside on the back porch. His other son, who was first in the argument with the victim, then threw his brother’s bags off the back porch, according to the warrants.The victim then began throwing patio furniture in the backyard. Lamadrid was still holding the shotgun as the furniture was being thrown around, warrants show.According to Lamadrid, his son then threw a water bottle at him and hit him in the face, which caused him to squeeze the trigger and fire off a shot.The victim was hit in the hand and leg. Lamadrid told police he went to check on his son and then went inside to get dressed and wait for police to arrive.The victim suffered non-life threatening injuries.",fake

He also mentioned that President Trump’s wife, Melania takes their 11-year-old son, Barron to school, and that “We want to have a word with her.” Arnold then threatened to go to the school where Ivanka and Jared Kushner’s kids attend: “If we see babies tomorrow we’re going to Kushners kids school. It didn’t stop there, however. Arnold mocked Don Jr.’s five small children, as he made a sick attempt at humor, saying they’re “already working at Hooters so we’ll protest there for lunch.”Earlier in the day, the unhinged actor whose only claim to fame is being married once to comedian and actual actress Roseanne Barr, tweeted about the separation of children from their parents at the border, calling Trump and former AG Jeff Sessions, “white trash child abusing monsters”. Arnold openly threatened Trump and his administration, saying, “It ain’t over until the children are safe and the Trump Administration is not.”After reading this tweet and the one above, it’s actually shocking that it took the Secret Service so long to pay him the unstable, B-actor a visit.Arnold, who is desperate for attention, must’ve captured his visit on his security camera with the Secret Service on October 24th and sold it to the liberal rag, Mother Jones.During their visit, the Secret Service agents impressed upon Arnold that not only is his rhetoric inappropriate, but that he could incite others to attempt to kill the President. Arnold, who appears to be unconcerned with his actions, recently tweeted about his visit from the Secret Service, and with no evidence whatsoever, attempted to blame President Trump for Cesar Sayoc, who was arrested for allegedly sending fake pipe bombs to anti-Trump legislators and anti-Trump news organizations. Like a petulant child who’s just been reprimanded, but can’t accept responsibility for his bad behavior, Arnold attempted to place the blame on Trump:Don’t blame Secret Service.They were doing their job.

455,27-Nov-18,"Homeland Security and President Trump blasted ’60 Minutes’ after they aired a segment on illegal alien family separation that was full of inaccuracies and propaganda (see below).President Trump took to Twitter to call the piece “phony” and DHS Assistant Press Secretary Katie Waldman released a blistering statement on Monday denouncing ’60 Minutes’:“’60 Minutes’ irresponsibly aired flawed reporting, which displayed a disregard for the truth and a fundamental misunderstanding of our nation’s immigration system and the Administration’s zero-tolerance policy for prosecuting illegal border crossers. DHS chose not to participate in the taping of this hit piece as it was clear from the start this was an agenda-driven work of revisionist fiction.”“The piece inaccurately conflated the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services—the former apprehends illegal aliens (including minors) for illegal acts and the latter is responsible for care and custody of unaccompanied alien minors. Additionally, ‘60 Minutes’ was complicit in allowing one interviewee to peddle absurd fabrications about the actions of the men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol as they carried out the Administration’s zero-tolerance policy.”OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE ’60 MINUTES’ PIECE:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]60 Minutes ran a hit piece on President Trump and his border policies. Their segment featured families who entered the US illegally and were subsequently separated. They ignored the massive crowd of thousands of illegal aliens who’ve been threatening to rush our borders and cross into the United States illegally. 60 Minutes glossed over the part about the coyotes who bring children over with them that are in no way related to them.Almost every video taken by people who have witnessed the caravan of illegal aliens headed for the southern border of the United States and Mexico show a mostly male caravan. 60 Minutes took a page from the propaganda playbook of the media last May when instead of reporting the truth, they attempted to make President Trump look like an evil monster for denying these young children and their families a better life.Here is a tweet with a video from the 60 Minutes segment that was used to promote their show last night:“Are they going to take me away again?” 60 Minutes cameras capture what it’s really like for families who were separated at the border.

Fake 60 Minutes!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2018President Trump is correct about 60 Minutes peddling fake news as a way to turn Americans against him and his fight to defend our nation against an illegal invasion. After Democrats organized protests across America, and Hollywood took to social media to condemn President for a photo that emerged of illegal alien kids in cages, conservative media outlets revealed that the photo that caused so much outrage for our President was actually a photo that was taken of children in an immigration shelter in 2014, while Barack Obama was President.Here’s a telling clip showing President Obama expressing his tough views on immigration.https://www.facebook.com/IThink4SheepleWakeUp/videos/259780958011707/?hc_ref=ARTGIbrBHall0aFv13XsGUeW2Idta_yPFD7on8s6N00w80euG8wue8Xku0eyKCgu3zU&fref=gs&dti=718940071545073&hc_location=groupEven the New York Times, who on almost every occasion, goes out of their way to report or create negative news that can harm our current President, wrote about the lies that were being peddled by the Left and their allies in the dishonest media about children who were separated from their parents [many times, the children who were separated were not really the children of the adults who brought them across] at the border.The New York Times wrote:Over the weekend, you may have seen a horrifying story: Almost 1,500 migrant children were missing, and feared to be in the hands of human traffickers. The Trump administration lost track of the children, the story went, after separating them from their parents at the border.The news spread across liberal social media — with the hashtag #Wherearethechildren trending on Twitter — as people demanded immediate action.But it wasn’t true, or at least not the way that many thought. The narrative had combined parts of two real events and wound up with a horror story that was at least partly a myth.The fact that so many Americans readily believed this myth offers a lesson in how partisan polarization colors people’s views on a gut emotional level without many even realizing it.As other articles have explained, the missing children and the Trump administration’s separation of families who are apprehended at the border are two different matters.The Trump administration does, in fact, have a new policy of prosecuting all undocumented border crossers, which involves separating parents from their children. But the 1,475 children whom the Department of Health and Human Services recently reported it cannot locate are not among those taken from their parents. These “missing” children had actually come to the United States without their parents, been picked up by the Border Patrol and then released to the custody of a parent or guardian.Many probably are not really missing. The figure represents the number of children whose households didn’t answer the phone when the Department of Health and Human Services called to check on them. The unanswered phone calls may warrant further welfare checks, but are not themselves a sign that something nefarious has happened.The Obama administration also detained immigrant families and children, as did other recent administrations.This past weekend, some social media users circulated a photo they said showed children detained as a result of President Trump’s policies, but the image was actually from 2014.Some waved off this seeming contradiction, saying Mr. Trump’s other harsh immigration policies put his administration’s actions in a different context. And it is true that even when using similar tactics, President Trump and President Obama have expressed very different attitudes toward immigration and espoused different goals.Those arguments underscore the degree to which this controversy is animated as much by attitudes toward the president and the way he has made immigration a focus of partisan conflict as by specific policy preferences.Here is a clip from the 60 Minute piece created to paint a much different picture than that of the thousands of mostly men who are currently attempting to rush our borders, as they throw rocks at our US Border Patrol agents.",fake

We’ve watched in several videos that the women and children are always pushed to the front to garner sympathy for the group and to stop the border patrol from using force.Who puts their children in dangerous situations like this?“What we saw over and over yesterday was that the group…the caravan, as we call them…would push women and children to the front and then begin, basically, rocking our agents.”“They use women and children regularly.” – National Border Patrol Council President Brandon JuddIn fact, the Chief Patrol Agent for San Diego said these people could have surrendered but didn’t (see video below).CHIEF PATROL AGENT:“I kind of challenge that it was a peaceful protest or that the majority of these people were claiming asylum,” says the Chief Patrol Agent, San Diego Sector Border Control, explaining the decision to use tear gas. “42 crossed the border and were arrested”“If they were truly asylum seekers, they would have just walked up and surrendered and that did not take place,” says the Chief Patrol Agent, San Diego Sector Border Control, defending the decision to use tear gas.""If they were truly asylum seekers, they would have just walked up and surrendered and that did not take place,"" says the Chief Patrol Agent, San Diego Sector Border Control, defending the decision to use tear gas. https://t.co/w67XCL3JqD pic.twitter.com/ZWrl4N2bOM— New Day (@NewDay) November 26, 2018Nevertheless, Adolfo Flores of Buzzfeed News caught up with the mother in the iconic photo of her dragging her kids through what could’ve been a war zone, while cameramen in the back appear to be talking to groups of migrants (or perhaps members of their camera crews).In the video, the mother can be telling the cameraman that she just wants a job and that if she can’t find one in the US, she’ll stay in Tijuana, Mexico, and work. If she’s satisfied to stay in Tijuana and work, one has to wonder why she’s dragging her kids around through what appears to be a very dangerous zone filled with mostly male migrants to get to the U.S.Check out my video interview with the woman in the widely circulated picture of her running away from tear gas with her two daughters at the border on Sunday. https://t.co/tFT6oSb4rP pic.twitter.com/ZDJCGpBtHW— Adolfo Flores (@aflores) November 27, 2018This isn’t the first time an illegal alien mother and her children were used by the media as a way to gain sympathy from Americans for illegal invaders. Only five months ago, Time magazine used an image of a little girl standing alone and crying as ICE agents stood by. The image was used to portray a child who had been separated from her parents at the border by President Trump’s awful immigration policies that were actually the same policies the Obama administration had in place when he took office. The image turned out to be a hoax, as the young girl was never separated from her mother, who was in fact, standing right next to her when the photo was taken.A Honduran asylum seeker, 2, and her mother are taken into custody near the US-Mexico border.

472,20-Nov-18,"Seven months ago, a Henry Ford Hospital emergency room doctor was arrested for the female mutilation of young girls 6-8 years old. Young girls who traveled with their families to Dr. Nagarwala for the barbaric “procedure” were told they were going to Detroit for a “special girls trip.”The alleged genital mutilations were NOT performed by Dr. Nagarwala at the Henry Ford Hospital in Dearborn, MI. Authorities are saying the procedures took place at the Dr. Attar owned Burhani Medical Clinic in Livonia, MI.The child victim also stated that she said she had to go to the doctor “to get the germs out.” Upon a medical exam on April 11, a doctor determined that the child’s genitals had been altered or removed. The child identified Dr. Nagarwala as the doctor who performed the procedure.This practice though widely accepted in the Middle East is (at least for now) against the law in the United States.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]A second Michigan doctor and his wife were also arrested and charged with performing female genital mutilation on minors, according to the U.S. Justice Department.Fakhruddin Attar, 53, and his wife, Farida Attar, 50, of Livonia, were both arrested and have been charged with conspiring to perform female genital mutilations on minor girls out of Dr. Attar’s medical clinic in Livonia.The Detroit News – The ruling by U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman comes two weeks after defense lawyers mounted the first challenge to a 22-year-old genital mutilation law that went unused until April 2017.That’s when Dr. Jumana Nagarwala of Northville was arrested and accused of heading a conspiracy that lasted 12 years, involved seven other people and led to mutilating the genitalia of nine girls as part of a religious procedure practiced by some members of the Dawoodi Bohra, a Muslim sect from India that has a small community in Metro Detroit.Friedman delivered a significant, but not fatal, blow to a novel criminal prosecution being closely followed by members of the sect and international human-rights groups opposed to female genital mutilation. The case raised awareness in the U.S. of a controversial procedure and prompted Michigan to enact new laws criminalizing female genital mutilation.Friedman removed four defendants from the case — including three mothers accused of subjecting their daughters to female genital mutilation — while concluding Congress had no authority to enact a law criminalizing female genital mutilation, known as FGM.“There is nothing commercial or economic about FGM,” Friedman wrote in a 28-page opinion. (Female genital mutilation) is not part of a larger market and it has no demonstrated effect on interstate commerce.

477,18-Nov-18,"Last week, Democrats in Minnesota elected Muslim US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who will be filling the seat of the disgraced outgoing Muslim congressman, Keith Ellison, who was recently forced to resign as the DNC vice chair, after multiple credible accusations of domestic violence.The Somali-born Muslim lawmaker, Ilhan Omar, brings her own set of baggage with her to Washington DC, including multiple campaign finance violation charges as well as a controversy surrounding allegations that she committed immigration fraud when she married and then divorced her own brother.On October 9, 2018, it was revealed in a report sent to Rep. Steve Drazkowski (R-Mazeppa) by the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board (CFB), that there is “probable cause” against Omar and her state legislature campaign committee for at least three separate violations, which are now being investigated.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Last week, the CFB conducted a hearing to determine whether probable cause exists for Omar’s use of campaign resources for personal travel expenses. Now, according to Drazkowski, the CFB has determined probable cause exists and are moving forward with a formal investigation.Last week, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar came out against the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement during her campaign, but after winning the election, she now says she “supports the BDS movement.”Omar, a Muslim Somali-American elected last week to replace outgoing Rep. Keith Ellison (D., Minn.) in the House, fought accusations that she held anti-Israel views during her campaign. As part of that effort, she told a group of Jewish voters in the state that she opposed the economic boycott of Israel, calling it “counteractive” and “not helpful in getting that two-state solution.”But Omar’s tune has changed since winning the election. In an interview published Sunday by MuslimGirl, Omar said she “supports the BDS movement.”“Ilhan believes in and supports the BDS movement, and has fought to make sure people’s right to support it isn’t criminalized,” her campaign told MuslimGirl, which said Omar had been criticized for coming out against BDS. Omar’s campaign also pointed MuslimGirl to her vote against an anti-BDS bill in Minnesota’s state legislature and her argument that boycott movements were successful in South Africa.The comment is seen as a complete reversal by members of the Jewish community in her district.“She’s either misrepresenting or misunderstanding, and I hope to be able to have a dialogue with her that clarifies which of those is the nature of her stance,” Rabbi Avi Olitzky, who hosted the event where Omar came out against BDS, told Forward, a Jewish news outlet.Omar defended her comments in text messages to a local Jewish reporter, saying the moderator “didn’t ask for a yes or no answer” at the initial event. Omar was asked during the debate to state “exactly where you stand” on BDS.Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. #Gaza #Palestine #IsraelAccording to the New York Post, it’s taken 181 years, but the House of Representatives is finally getting around to changing a rule that bans hats on the floor.The ban was enacted in 1837 by members who wanted to break from the hat-wearing tradition in British Parliament.They didn’t anticipate Ilhan Omar.The Minnesota Democrat is one of two Muslim women elected this year and she’s the first to wear a hijab.Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman also praised the changes. The New Jersey Democrat had a tumor successfully removed and has undergone chemotherapy since September to ensure she’s cancer-free.The treatment caused her hair to fall out. She wears a hat outside, but when she votes on the House floor she takes it off.“I just have a bald head and I’m somewhat getting used to it hoping that it’s a very temporary thing,” Watson Coleman told The Post.“I don’t think I would start wearing a (hat) now, but I recognize that if someone else has the same issue and wants to, they should be able to.”A Democratic source said the rules will be clarified to allow religious headwear, as well as coverings for medical reasons.How very tolerant.

Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., argued Thursday that prior proposals to ban assault weapons “would leave millions of assault weapons in our communities for decades to come.”Swalwell praised Australia’s gun control measures in his op-ed and suggested that America needs to follow suit…Swalwell proposes that the government should offer up to $1,000 for every weapon covered by a new ban, estimating that it would take $15 billion to buy back roughly 15 million weapons — and “criminally prosecute any who choose to defy [the buyback] by keeping their weapons.”In the past, Democrats and gun safety groups have carefully resisted proposals that could be interpreted as “gun confiscation,” a concept gun rights groups have often invoked as part of a slippery slope argument against more modest proposals like universal background checks.Swalwell addressed these arguments directly, saying he and other Democrats had been too deferential to Second Amendment activists and should follow the lead of teenage survivors of the Parkland shooting who have been more strident.“There’s something new and different about the surviving Parkland high schoolers’ demands,” he wrote. “They dismiss the moral equivalence we’ve made for far too long regarding the Second Amendment. I’ve been guilty of it myself, telling constituents and reporters that ‘we can protect the Second Amendment and protect lives.’”Instead, he writes, “the right to live is supreme over any other.”  ",fake

His second wife was only 13-years-old when he married her.In 2016, the Independent UK reported that Germany’s justice minister, Heiko Maas, claimed Germany was ending their unofficial tolerance of polygamy including marriages to a minor.“No one who comes to us has the right to put their cultural roots, or their religious beliefs, above our laws,” Mr. Maas told Bild newspaper.“For that reason, multiple marriages cannot be recognized in Germany.”Mass also admitted that while polygamy a crime in Germany, he alleges German authorities “often look the other way” if a migrant brings several wives to the country.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]According to Achmad, a Syrian refugee, polygamy is alive and well in his government-funded home in Germany. Listen to his incredible story, as he tells about the benefits he and his large family receive. While relaying his personal account of what life is like for a Muslim refugee in Germany, he explains how he has multiple wives, one of them who is currently living with him, became his bride at the age of 13 years. Achmad, an unskilled worker is separated from his third wife. Ahmad explains there is no jealousy between his wives because he does not permit it.  Achmad is a perfect example of how refugees are rewarded with housing, spending money, education, health care and even phone cards for calling home, all at the expense of German taxpayers. The only thing they need to do is make it across the border into Angela Merkle’s new Germany.Sharia Germany! Polygamy is now legal & taxpayer funded — provided you’re a male ""Refugee""""Achmed had always wanted to go to Germany – Here we get support. They give us welfare benefits. They gave us this house.

How much AG II people get depends on a person’s family status and living situation and how high average living expenses are where they live.Currently, a single adult receives € 408/month on average for everything but rent and health insurance, which the state pays for. AG-II recipients can also apply for extra funds e.g. for the basic furnishing of their apartment or if their child is going on a class trip.  The state usually pays enough rent for someone on AG II to live in a reasonably sized apartment, but not enough to live in any sought-after neighborhood, leaving most refugees to find apartments in less popular outer boroughs. To give two examples: In Bonn, a city in central western Germany with comparatively high living costs, a person living alone receives up to 487 €/month plus heating expenses. In Berlin, it’s 365 €/month for singles, 437 €/month for two people living together, plus utilities.This leaves many refugees with a net income of less than 60 percent of the average German income (917 € and 1530€ for a single person), and thus below the poverty line.What the state pays asylum seekersAccording to Germany’s Asylum-Seekers’ Benefits Act, the state has to provide accommodation, food, toiletries, clothes, necessary household items and  “benefits to cover personal needs in everyday life,” like a telephone card to communicate with family left back home, to asylum seekers.German and integration classes for asylum seekers and refugees are also paid for by the state.",fake

He really understood, and I am very hopeful that this will turn out really positively.”Kardashian West initially became involved in Johnson’s case in October when she saw a Mic Opinion video featuring Johnson sharing her story from prison.“I saw your video,” Kardashian West told Mic. “If you think about a decision that you’ve made in your life and you get life without the possibility of parole for your first-time nonviolent offense, there’s just something so wrong with that.”After tweeting that video, Kardashian West enlisted her personal attorney Shawn Chapman Holley to provide legal support for Johnson’s clemency petition. She has since worked behind the scenes to advocate for Johnson’s release and even received a letterin November directly from Johnson.Mic reported in May that Kardashian West had spoken multiple times to Trump’s son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner in recent months about Johnson’s case. Kardashian West and Kushner’s phone conversations about Johnson picked up in recent weeks, which prompted Kushner to bring Johnson’s file in front of White House attorneys, and then Trump, about a potential release.Now Johnson will be released from prison just after celebrating her 63rd birthday and after more than 21 years behind bars.Johnson was convicted for her role facilitating communications in a cocaine trafficking operation in Memphis, Tennessee. She was given a life sentence without the possibility of parole, plus 25 years, after her co-conspirators testified against her in court.After Kardashian’s visit, the left, who claims to be a champion of the underprivileged, including those unjustly imprisoned in America, went ballistic.Kim Kardashian stood strong against the critics, however, and thanked President Trump and Jared Kushner for showing compassion and for contributing “countless hours” to Johnson’s important case.

He got into a tug of war with her and refused to let go even when the president asked numerous times to stop.It’s very clear that Acosta’s goal is to disrupt and call attention to himself hoping to get his mug on the 6 o’clock news. Once again, this takes away from his colleague’s chances to ask questions.WAY TO ALIENATE YOUR VIEWERS:Fox News President Jay Wallace just jumped into the fray with a statement in support of Acosta when most people would concur that Acosta is just a huge distraction taking away everyone’s freedom of speech by hogging the spotlight:Fox News will file an amicus brief in support of @Acosta and CNN.

495,11-Nov-18,"UPDATE TO THIS STORY (12-7-18):According to the Washington Free Beacon, Congresswoman-elect Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) did not disclose the name of the source of funds for a fellowship that was paid by liberal billionaire George Soros—as required by the House ethics committee—and also disclosed a lesser amount than she received, according to a review of tax and financial disclosure forms.The Washington Free Beacon obtained the most recent copies of tax forms for a number of Soros’s organizations, including the Open Society Institute, the legal name for the Open Society Foundations, the entity in which Soros pushes millions in funding to a number of liberal causes and organizations.An expenditure of $85,307 to Rashida Tlaib in Detroit, Mich., from 2017 is shown on page 97 of the 321-page report to “to increase involvement of disenfranchised urban communities of color with their local governance process by creating a community benefits strategy for equitable development and creating a leadership training for impacted residents focused on negotiation skills and identifying leverage at the local level.”Tlaib did not report any income in the amount of $85,307 on financial disclosure forms submitted as she was running for office, which identified the names of the sources that provided her income in three of four cases. Tlaib received compensation from the Maurice & Jane Sugar Law Center, Wayne State University, and Metro Solutions, the forms show.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]However, the fourth reported source of earned income is marked as a “Leadership in Government Fellowship,” but does not identify who provided the payment.A press release from 2016 shows that Tlaib was chosen for a “leadership in government” fellowship by Soros’s Open Society Foundations along with seven other individuals.A spokesman for Soros’s Open Society Foundations said Tlaib’s fellowship was terminated earlier this year when she informed the group she would be running for Congress..Kendra Arnold, executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, said that Tlaib’s failure to report the source of her income is “problematic” due to rules requiring that the income source be identified.Candidates are required to disclose the name of groups and organizations that provide their source of income, according to the manual on financial disclosure statements from the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ethics.The $68,307 income marked for the “Leadership in Government Fellowship” on the financial disclosure forms is also $17,000 less than the $85,307 that was marked as being paid out by Soros’s group.Arnold said this discrepancy is not as clear and could be the result of hard costs associated with the program.TLAIB WRAPS HERSELF IN PALESTIAN FLAG AFTER WINNING MIDTERM ELECTION:On November 6 2018. Michigan voters in the 13th district, elected Rashida Tlaib to the be their next United States Congresswoman. Tlaib will be filling the seat of the disgraced Democrat Congressman, John Conyers, the longest running member of the House before he was quietly run out of DC amidst several sexual assault allegations against him. While Conyers was a sitting Congressman, his wife, Monica Conyers served a 3-year-term in prison for bribery while she was serving as a Detroit City Congresswoman. Former Congressman John Conyers (D) was hoping that his son would fill his seat, but when John Conyers III came up 1,000 signatures short on his petition to get his name on the primary ballot, Tlaib saw an opening in a weak US Congressional race and capitalized on it.Newsweek celebrated Tlaib’s win.Palestinians in the West Bank cheered on Wednesday morning as they awoke to the news that Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, had been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.Representing Michigan’s 13th congressional district, encompassing southwest Detroit and its western suburbs to the city of Dearborn, Tlaib, 42, made history, along with Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar, as they become the first Muslim women elected to Congress. Tlaib is also the first Palestinian-American woman elected to the legislative body. Both also ran on progressive Democrat platforms.She has become “a source of pride for Palestine and the entire Arab and Muslim world,” Tlaib’s uncle Bassam Tlaib told Reuters in the small Palestinian village of Beit Ur Al-Fauqa.Watch the video below, as Michigan’s first Muslim Congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib can be seen celebrating her victory by wrapping herself in the Palestinian flag and hugging her Palestinian mother.Listen, as she tells the crowd about how proud the Palestinians on the West Bank are of her nomination to the US Congress, and how they’re glued to their televisions. You can also hear what appears to be a middle eastern male in the background expressing his enthusiasm, as he almost drowns out the sound of Tlaib’s voice with his celebratory ululation (a shrill sounding tongue trill that is commonly heard in the Middle East).https://twitter.com/KhaledBeydoun/status/1060027114618085377When independent journalist Laura Loomer confronted Tlaib about her support for the terror group, Hamas, and asked her why she is campaigning with the open Jew-hating activist Linda Sarsour, Rashida Tlaib attempted to yank Loomer’s phone from her hand.Watch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqPcqlXiMDMNewsweek reported – Salem Barahmeh, executive director of the Ramallah-based Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy, said, “Tlaib’s election is seen as a glimmer of hope in a very dark chapter in the Palestinian people’s history.” But Barahmeh also cautioned that “change is incremental, and Palestinians in Palestine are intimately aware of that.”  ",fake

The board can begin meeting Monday to handle absentee ballots, more than 75,000 of which have been cast in Broward ahead of the Aug. 28 primaries.The ruling is the second major loss for Snipes’ office in court this year. In May, a judge criticized her office for breaking the law by destroying ballots too soon in the 2016 congressional primary between Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Tim Canova. Snipes earlier won a federal case concerning voter-roll maintenance. Broward has nearly 1.15 million voters, second only to Miami-Dade’s voter population of nearly 1.4 million.The absentee ballot case, controversy arose in 2016 when Republican poll watchers complained that Snipes’ staff was opening the ballots in private, thereby making it impossible for citizens or groups to question whether the ballots were properly cast.After Broward made a brief accommodation, the party sued in January of 2017 to make sure Snipes followed the law.Under state law, an elector or campaign can challenge the lawfulness of an absentee ballot, but only before the ballot has been opened from its mail-in envelope. By opening the ballot before it got to the three-member Canvassing Board, the Republican Party complained, Snipes’ office was breaking the law and making any challenge impossible.Though Snipes sits on her county’s Canvassing Board, her attorney appeared to make the novel argument that she didn’t know the meaning of the word “canvass,” an issue the judge brought up repeatedly in his 17-page ruling that also pointed out Snipes couldn’t show why he shouldn’t side with the party.“Defendant has failed to rebut Plaintiff’s entitlement to relief,” Judge Raag Singhal wrote in his order, “and has even admitted to misunderstanding the meaning of the word ‘canvass.’” –Politico",fake

Comedian George Lopez just faked urinating on President Trump’s Hollywood star. If he had any courage, he would have really unrelated but he’s such a child and a coward. The publicity stunt has backfired making Lopez look like a total goof on social media. Our favorite anti-Lopez tweet was just two words: “STAY CLASSY”Lopez has a history of anti-Trump behavior (see below) but this tops it all:George Lopez Pretends to Pee on Donald Trump's Hollywood Star https://t.co/aWrRJ1R3Wk— TMZ (@TMZ) July 12, 2018TMZ reports:George Lopez gave Donald Trump‘s Hollywood star his version of the No. 1 treatment … unleashing a massive fake pee stream all over it.The comedian — who has made no bones about his beef with the Prez — was in Hollywood Tuesday and coincidentally found himself right in front of Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame. After chatting up fans, George decided to unload his water bottle a la fake pee on Trump’s marker.Check it out … everyone seemed to enjoy the spectacle, and GLo was pretty relieved too. (Pun intended).PREVIOUS REPORTS ON ANTI-TRUMP STUNTS FROM GEORGE LOPEZ:George Lopez was hired to be the emcee for the Children’s Diabetes Foundation’s Carousel Ball. Lopez thought it would be a good idea to turn what should have been an event to help sick children into an opportunity to express his hate for President Trump and his supporters. Bad idea…Here’s the promotion for Lopez from the Children’s Diabetes Foundation on Twitter:https://twitter.com/CDFdiabetes/status/910965288761401344Comic George Lopez was booed off stage at a gala for juvenile diabetes in Denver last week, over an anti-Donald Trump routine that fell flat with the crowd.We’re told the flap began when Trump backer and Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei donated $250,000 but requested that Lopez cool it with the anti-Trump jokes at the Carousel Ball.An attendee at the event — where tables sold from $5,000 to $100,000 to benefit the Barbara Davis Center for Diabetes — commented on a YouTube video that “George was asked nicely to stop making Trump jokes by a man in front row [Maffei] who just donated $250K.” But “George doesn’t, continues. Gets booed.”We’re told that Lopez responded to Maffei, “Thank you for changing my opinion on old white men, but it doesn’t change the way I feel about orange men.”Trying to recover and sensing the audience turn, Lopez said, “Listen, it’s about the kids . . . I apologize for bringing politics to an event. This is America — it still is. So I apologize to your white privilege.”We’re told Lopez also told a joke about Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico, saying, “I guess you can get some Mexicans to do it cheaper and they wouldn’t crush the tunnels ­underneath.”When the audience did not respond well, he quipped, “Are you El Chapo people?” in reference to the drug kingpin who has used tunnels to evade authorities.Lopez then announced a video segment — but he did not return to the stage, and a local newscaster took over the hosting duties.Host of HUGE charity #CarouselBall, @georgelopez , makes political comments about Trump, drops f-bomb and is escorted out.— God/Family/Country (@americarocks4u) October 14, 2017TV host Chris Parente posted on Twitter, “big controversy: host of HUGE charity #CarouselBall, @georgelopez, makes political comments about Trump, drops f-bomb and is escorted out.” –Page SixChris Parente’s tweet has since been deleted.",fake

She is currently in a heated, toss-up race against Missouri Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley.U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill has outraised her Republican challenger by a more than 2 to 1 margin since July, but she’s also been spending money at a faster rate than she’s collecting it.The Missouri Democrat, who has faced frequent attacks from President Donald Trump, raised nearly $8.5 million from July 1 through Sept. 30, a record for the quarter in Missouri, according to her campaign.Between July and September, McCaskill spent roughly $12 million on the race, which could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. She goes into the final weeks of the election with nearly $3.2 million in her campaign coffers.After Missouri voters see the bait and switch she and her staff have been attempting to pull off on voters, her chances of defeating her Republican opponent in what is being called a “toss-up” race for Senator are not looking very good. James O’Keefe of Project Veritas just released an undercover video of the anti-Trump, anti-Kavanaugh Senator and her staff revealing their true intentions on the issues of gun control and abortion. They also talk about the Democrat plan to impeach Trump, after lying to her constituents about it.One of the best parts of the video comes at the end, when a male member of McCaskill’s staff talks about how even though ideologically, she aligns with former President Obama, she doesn’t want him to come to the state of Missouri to campaign with her, because she doesn’t want her constituents to make the connection between her and America’s worst president ever.Watch Claire McCaskill and her staff admit how the Senator tells Republicans voters in Missouri one thing while planning to do the opposite thing after she gets reelected:Via Project Veritas:Senator McCaskill Talks Gun Bans on TapeSenator McCaskill revealed her intention to vote on various gun control measures in undercover footage:MCCASKILL: “Well if we elect enough Democrats we’ll get some gun safety stuff done. They won’t let us vote on it, we’ve got 60 votes for a number of measures that would help with gun safety, but McConnell won’t let ’em come to the floor.”JOURNALIST: “Like bump stocks, ARs and high capacity mags…?”MCCASKILL: “Universal background checks, all of that… But if we have the kind of year I think we might have I think we could actually be in a position to get votes on this stuff on the floor and we’d get 60 [votes]…”JOURNALIST: “So you would be on board with the bump stocks and… high capacity mags.”MCCASKILL: “Of course! Of course!”Despite her strong views on gun control, Senator McCaskill does not tend to promote them on the campaign trail or on her website. Rob Mills, who works on Senator McCaskill’s campaign, says that is “…because she has a bunch of Republican voters.”Another individual who works on Senator McCaskill campaign, Carson Pope, adds that “…a semi-automatic rifle ban is more so what she would support.”Nicolas Starost, another individual who works on Senator McCaskill’s campaign, explains how President Obama won’t campaign for Senator McCaskill in Missouri despite their similar views on politics. Starost says this is because Senator McCaskill needs to distance herself from the Democratic party to appeal to more voters:STAROST: “Because of how like, cause he’s a very liberal candidate. And like… Claire distancing herself from the party is gonna help her win more votes than it will saying like: “Oh here’s Obama, the former President of the United States, to now speak on my behalf.” Which is unfortunate because I love Obama to pieces, and I’d love to see him come here.”JOURNALIST: “And they essentially have the same views on everything?”STAROST: “Yeah.

Owens laughed sarcastically, and told the crowd, “If I am rich, please let my parents know. That would be very interesting, versus the way that I actually grew up.” Owens immediately clarified that the truth is, that “Yes, I was raised in Connecticut. I was raised in Stanford, Connecticut, and my family is not, not was, most of my family wasn’t on welfare, they currently are on welfare. I come from a background where I grew up seeing my uncles in prison. And, uh, I grew up with a broken family, a very typical, what I would say a ‘black American story'”. She then explained how the media is trying to silence her because based on her upbringing, she should be a Democrat. Owens quickly assured the crowd, “I am not a Democrat!”The entire video can be seen below (every second of the video is worth watching).Here is a short clip that Owens posted on Twitter from her speech:Perhaps racism is being used as a theme to turn black people into single-issue voters.Every single day on the television we saw Black Lives Matter protesters.By the way, has anyone seen Black Lives Matter on CNN, since the election ended? I haven’t, because guess what? Once the election’s over, they no longer need to black people like mules to bring them votes. And that’s exactly what’s going on. FACT: The word “racism” is repeated obsessively by people who wish to enslave black people to the Democratic Party. #BlackVotesMatter to @RepMaxineWaters @CoryBooker pic.twitter.com/HbnrRDirHI— Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) May 14, 2018Here’s Candace Owens’ entire speech:“We’re fighting every day for African-Americans, for more jobs, for higher wages, for safer communities, for great schools, and we want school choice.

521,04-Nov-18,"What does Elissa Slotkin, Democrat candidate for Congress in Michigan’s 8th district, and former CIA analyst, have to do with the creation of ISIS in the Middle East? According to Senator John McCain, Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, while working with the Obama regime, made the decision to pull our US troops from Iraq, leaving a vacuum for ISIS, the worst terrorist group in modern history, to recruit, organize and metastasize.President George W. Bush, at the end of his Presidency, warned America of the risk of withdrawing precipitously from Iraq.  Nevertheless, the United States military forces, under the direction of then President Obama, quickly started a withdrawal from Iraq that was completed in 2011. Not coincidentally, by April of 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq had united with al-Nusra Front to form Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).At that time, ISIS was confined to the immediate area of Iraq and Syria. President Obama famously referred to ISIS nine months later in January of 2014 as the “JV team.”  Just over a year later, however, according to ABC News, on “the second anniversary of the declaration of its Islamic ‘caliphate,’ or kingdom . . . the group has gone from obscurity . . .  to the world’s most brutal terrorist network, not only responsible for thousands of deaths in the Middle East but also linked to hundreds more in dozens of terrorist plots in the West.”By the end of Obama’s second term, December of 2016, according to CNN, “the self-proclaimed Islamic State has conducted or inspired more than 140 terrorist attacks in 29 countries other than Iraq and Syria, where its carnage has taken a much deadlier toll. Those attacks have killed at least 2,043 people and injured thousands more.” –ForbesWhile he was campaigning for president, Donald Trump made a commitment to voters that he would wipe out ISIS.  He also called out Barack Obama for his horrific decision to pull our US troops out of Iraq, calling him the “founder of ISIS” and Hillary Clinton, for her part, the “co-founder” of ISIS.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Donald Trump neglected to mention one of the key players in the horrific decision to pull our US troops out of Iraq, Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat Party plant, running for US Congress in Michigan’s 8th district against conservative Republican Congressman Mike Bishop. In 2014, when Slotkin was the acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Foreign Affairs and International Policy, she was questioned about her involvement in the decision to pull our troops by the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, Senator John McCain, during a confirmation hearing where Slotkin was rejected for the position of Assistant Secretary for International Security Affairs under Hillary Clinton.Watch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH_lkeCluMAWhy would Michigan send Elissa Slotkin to Congress? Have Americans already forgotten the fear and horror we felt, as we watched innocent Christians, Jews, Muslims and Yazidi’s being beaten, beheaded, burned and drowned in cages, or the images of 30 Christian men tied together as they marched to their deaths?Are four years ago too long ago, to remember images of Iraqis citizens literally running from ISIS as they headed into Mosul in death caravans?And what about the innocent young men who were captured by ISIS at gunpoint and loaded onto trucks in Tikrit? Have we already forgotten about them? Whatever happened to them? Are any of these young men alive, or were they brutally killed and buried in shallow graves?Have we forgotten about the next generation of children who were indoctrinated by ISIS to hate Christians and Americans?And what about the images of women, young girls, and even young boys were captured and sold as sex slaves?Why would Michigan residents want to hire someone as incompetent as Elissa Slotkin to represent them in Washington DC?",fake

I come from a background where I grew up seeing my uncles in prison. And, uh, I grew up with a broken family, a very typical, what I would say a ‘black American story'”.

He discouraged domestic energy production – for example, refusing to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline and openly attempting to bankrupt the coal industry.The economy is now booming because President Trump took the opposite course.

Pete Gallego for the Senate District 19 seat after receiving backing from some of the state’s most prominent politicians, including Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and U.S. Sens John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.“We conservatives are conservative in the way we make approaches. The gunfight’s not over until the last shot’s fired,” Flores told the Express-News after Gallego conceded in a phone call just before 9 p.m. “The last shot’s been fired.”According to the Secretary of State’s website, Flores won with 53 percent of the vote to Gallego’s 47 percent with 44,487 ballots cast.Flores and Gallego competed in Tuesday’s runoff after emerging from an eight-candidate field in first- and second place, respectively, in July’s special election to replace former Sen. Carlos Uresti. The longtime lawmaker vacated his seat in June after being convicted of 11 felony charges.In his victory speech, Flores reflected on the historic significance of his win and the job ahead.“This district has not been Republican since Reconstruction. And in September of 2018, it’s Republican once again,” Flores told supporters. “The work starts tomorrow.”Democrats are not going to like the video below, that shows Hispanic residents speaking out against Democrats and in support of Republican Pete Flores:Flores’ win marked an incredible upset in a district that political observers said shouldn’t have been competitive for Republicans.

547,29-Oct-18,"Former CIA analyst, Elissa Slotkin is running for US Congress in a state where she only recently dropped in to occupy a family farm that is owned by her wealthy family, heirs to the Hygrade Foods fortune.The Slotkin family farm is located in Holly, MI, and just happens to be located on the edge of the 8th district in Michigan, where Elissa Slotkin, a Jewish female, is backed by the J-Street PAC, a group which has been accused of being anti-Israel. In addition to her funding from the anti-Israel group, Slotkin’s also received an enormous amount of campaign cash from ACT Blue, a George Soros funded group.The Democrat Party and Elissa Slotkin, a DC outsider, who’s spent the last several months attempting to convince Michigan voters she cares about them, after voting for the first time ever in Michigan, when she voted for herself in the Democrat primary election in August, is hoping to unseat the popular, conservative, pro-Israel, Congressman Mike Bishop (R).It’s hard to imagine a more unbelievable scenario than that of a Jewish Democrat running for a seat in Congress, who’s being funded by an anti-Israel PAC.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The Republican Party of Wisconsin announced its “stop J Street Campaign” in February, focused on defeating the congressional campaign of J Street PAC cofounder Dan Kohl for the House of Representatives. J Street is a D.C.-based organization that claims to be “pro-peace” and “pro-Israel” but which critics have described as “anti-Israel.” The group has been censured for inviting individuals with anti-Israel views to their conferences.The Michigan GOP is joining with its Wisconsin counterpart to hit J Street-backed candidate Elissa Slotkin, running for the House of Representatives in Michigan’s eighth district. Slotkin is strongly backed by J Street, which solicits donations for her on its website.Slotkin’s previous foreign policy work may have influenced J Street’s decision to back her. Slotkin worked to build support for the Iran deal while at the Department of Defense and has since publicly voiced her support for it.Slotkin’s work history includes being blindsided by the rise of ISIS. Slotkin was involved in a closed-door briefing in 2014, the Free Beacon previously reported, in which DOD officials admitted that they did not foresee ISIS seizing as much power as it had. On her last day at DOD, Slotkin publicly butted heads with Secretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis. She insisted the United States was doing enough to combat ISIS, while Mattis pushed ahead with the faster timeline that lead to brutal defeat for the terrorist group.In addition to J Street, Slotkin has been backed by Obama-era Iran deal authors and advocates Ben Rhodes and Samantha Power. Slotkin’s campaign did not return a request for comment for this article.“The anti-Israel lobby and J Street are working with Nancy Pelosi and other extremists to knock off pro-Israel conservatives and replace them with candidates who support dangerous anti-Israel policies like the Iran Deal,” said Michigan Republican Party Chairman Ron Weiser. “Elissa Slotkin helped create the policies that created the Iran Deal and continuously underestimated the threat of ISIS. We must stop the radical agenda of J Street, Nancy Pelosi, and others who seek to place D.C. insiders like Elissa Slotkin in Congress to undermine the policies that keep this nation safe.”Slotkin’s Republican opponent, Rep. Mike Bishop, voted against the Iran deal, saying it “enables a belligerent state sponsor of terror to gain access to hundreds of billions of dollars and a path to nuclear weapons.” Bishop has also been an outspoken supporter of Israel, including backing its attacks on Hamas in the summer of 2014.“A nation’s first priority is to protect its citizens and Israel has the right to protect its citizens against this aggression. I call on President Obama to support Israel, condemn Hamas, and call for an end to Hamas’s participation in the Palestinian Authority,” Bishop said at the time.Marc A. Thiessen of the Washington Post explained how Barack Obama and his regime “took lying to new heights” after their dirty dealings with Iran were revealed.When it comes to the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama administration increasingly appears to have been a bottomless pit of deception.First, President Barack Obama failed to disclose to Congress the existence of secret side deals on inspections when he transmitted the nuclear accord to Capitol Hill. (They were only uncovered by chance when then-Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) learned about them during a meeting with International Atomic Energy Agency officials in Vienna.) Then, we learned that the Obama administration had secretly sent a plane to Tehran loaded with $400 million in Swiss francs, euros and other currencies on the same day Iran released four American hostages, which was followed by two more secret flights carrying another $1.3 billion in cash.Now, in a bombshell revelation, Republicans on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), have revealed in a new report that the Obama administration secretly tried to help Iran use U.S. banks to convert $5.7 billion in Iranian assets, after promising Congress that Iran would not get access to the U.S. financial system — and then lied to Congress about what it had done. (Full disclosure: My wife works for Portman).In July 2015, Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew assured the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that, under the nuclear accord, Iran “will continue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market” and that “Iranian banks will not be able to clear U.S. dollars through New York, hold correspondent account relationships with U.S. financial institutions, or enter into financing arrangements with U.S. banks.” A few weeks later, one of Lew’s top deputies, Adam Szubin, used the exact same words in testimony to the Senate banking committee.But Senate investigators found that on Feb. 24, 2016, the Obama Treasury Department “granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system” — exactly what Lew and Szubin said would not happen — including unlimited future Iranian deposits at Bank Muscat in Oman until the license expired.Not only that, Senate investigators found that officials from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which regulates U.S. banks’ compliance with U.S. sanctions law, “encouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds.” The report says “both banks declined to complete the transaction due to compliance, reputational, and legal risks associated with doing business with Iran.”How bad is this? Remove the words “Obama” and “Iran” and replace them with “Trump” and “Russia” and imagine the outrage that would ensue over the same revelations. Democrats would be holding news conferences, and the story would be front-page news.We hear a lot these days from the media about the danger of presidential lies. Well, when it comes to the Iran deal, the Obama administration took lying to new heights. And no, that’s not Fake News.",fake

While only about 50 candidates remain since the recent primaries, the number is still higher than it has been since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Comparatively, only about one dozen Muslims ran for office in 2016. That’s a 650% increase in Muslims running for political office in the US in only one year.In 2016, Ilhan Ilhan Omar’s website attributed her win to immigrant Somalis: “More than 250 volunteers and 450 individual donors supported Ilhan’s campaign. ‘I am so proud that the majority of contributions to my campaign are from members of the Somali community who believe in my leadership,’” the site said.

You be the judge on whether the Mexican government is standing down and enabling the caravan or not…So what’s the Mexican President doing about this? Read what he said in a speech during his camapign and you be the judge…The last paragraph of the Mexican President’s speech from July 2017 was translated from Spanish to English for you:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]We took screen shots of translations from Spanish to English of comments people made about his speech. They understood what he said in his speech but you be the judge…“This man, is the maximum, he wants to leave the third world to the first world, if we really want a change let’s do it, Undoubtedly 2018 !!”The two articles that reported on this speech could not be translated by Google translate into English but the quote was translated by the Daily Caller to read:(From the Daily Caller) […] “And soon, very soon — after the victory of our movement — we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,” Obrador said, adding that immigrants “must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.”  He then declared it as “a human right we will defend.” We checked out the video (in Spanish) of the future Mexican President and it seems to us that those commenting in Spanish got the gist of what he was saying:Open borders advocates on the left see policing the border as a form of cruelty and American imperialism. There are also radical organizations that feel Mexico deserves a southern portion of America.TUCKER CARLSON SPOKE ABOUT THE MEXICAN MIGRATION A FEW MONTHS AGO:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQoTOdyIlc4La Raza aka “The Race” is a radical organization seeking open borders along with many of the George Soros-funded open borders groups:THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO… Andrés Manuel López Obrador aka AMLO;YOU BE THE JUDGE ON THIS REPORT FROM TWO RELIABLE WEBSITES:(From the Daily Caller) […] “And soon, very soon — after the victory of our movement — we will defend all the migrants in the American continent and all the migrants in the world,” Obrador said, adding that immigrants “must leave their towns and find a life in the United States.”  He then declared it as “a human right we will defend.”The Conservative Treehouse warns:It would take Mexico several decades to achieve a level of wealth even close to the U.S., and they have no structural (political) systems in place to form the foundation of such an approach.  So, AMLO’s faster plan is to use migration into the U.S. to break down barriers, collapse the economic dam and allow the natural flood of U.S. wealth to flow into Mexico.From the Mexican perspective this is a pretty solid economic approach that just might work; and they have open-border comrades within the progressive, democrat, republican and corporate political systems (all over the U.S) who already support such a strategy.So when you see the headlines about the Mexican President telling his people to leave; and when you see him telling government officials to formulate plans and policies to expedite entry into the U.S., don’t laugh them away.  It is a viable plan with just as much possibility of success as any other.",fake

Prior to that tax reform being passed, corporates were sitting at record profits as a percent of GDP, record cash reserves, and wages were at an all-time low relative to GDP.” Casten thinks most Americans are seeing no benefit from the tax cut:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“By giving a tax cut to corporates to the top one percent, 83 percent of the tax cut went to the people who didn’t need it.

And when 35 percent of U.S. equities are owned by foreigners that means that more money left the country from the tax bill than flowed to 99 percent of Americans.”Casten is the bigmouth that compared President Trump to Osama bin Laden back in August.

578,22-Oct-18,"Last week, a group of young conservatives waited outside of a Howell, MI debate event for Nancy Pelosi plant, Democrat Elissa Slotkin with a pallet of cash and t-shirts that read: “Slotkin’s Cash For Iran”.Their objective was to inform Michigan voters of the former CIA analyst, Elissa Slotkin’s involvement in Obama’s secret deal that sent $1 billion in cash to Iran officials.Slotkin is virtually unknown in Michigan, where she’s asking voters to choose her over the conservative US Congressman Mike Bishop.  Slotkin, who’s never owned a home in Michigan, never paid taxes in Michigan, and never voted in a Michigan election, until her name appeared on the ballot in the August primary election, touts her transparency with voters as a reason to vote for her.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]To date, the former CIA analyst has accumulated an astounding $5.5 million in contributions from mostly out of state donations. Like Ted Cruz’s opponent, Beto O’Rourke, most of her campaign contributions are coming from the Soros funded ACT BLUE.  Unions and pro-abortion groups make up a large portion of the donations collected to fund her campaign.During the debate, Democrat Elissa Slotkin mocked Congressman Bishop for attempting to maintain control on his campaign events. What Slotkin neglected to mention, however, were the Democrat mobs who followed him around during a Christmas parade in his hometown of Rochester, MI, while screaming vulgarities at him. Congressman Bishop was forced to be surrounded by four Sheriff deputy officers due to their threatening behavior. Bishop has repeatedly been followed by Democrat mobs to his car after campaign events where they’ve formed human chains around him, refusing to allow him to leave the parking lot.Slotkin mocked Bishop for being cautious about allowing Democrat thugs into his events, saying she would be more willing than her opponent to answer questions from Michigan residents she would represent. Immediately following the debate, Slotkin was asked by a Michigan resident about her involvement in Obama’s shady Iran deal that sent pallets of cash to Iran that ultimately funded terrorism. The Democrat candidate who only moments before at the debate, promised to answer her constituents questions, ran from the question about her involvement in the Iran deal.Watch what happens when Slotkin is asked a question by a Michigan resident:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Moc_JEQcqMIn 2014, Senator John McCain went scorched earth on Elissa Slotkin, the US Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary for International Security Affairs under Hillary Clinton, during her appearance at the House Foreign Affairs Committee, over her involvement in the pulling out of troops from Iraq, which ultimately allowed ISIS to flourish and grow their terror network in the middle east.During the hearing, John McCain accused Slotkin of being a liar: “In all due respect to you, Ms. Slotkin, you either don’t know the truth or you are not telling the truth to this committee, because we could have left a stabilizing force behind.”Watch:An astounding $247K has already been raised for Slotkin’s campaign by the House Victory Project.According to the New York Times, the House Victory Project is a group of major Democratic donors in New York who have discreetly formed a new political alliance to raise roughly $10 million that would be injected into as many as two dozen key House battlegrounds in an effort to wrest control of Congress from Republicans.Democrat Elissa Slotkin is #7 on the list of top-funded candidates by the House Victory Project:The group is focusing on bolstering Democratic candidates in general election battleground races, with the goal of flipping 24 Republican seats to take the House in November.The idea is to win 24 highly curated races,” said Alan Patricof, a venture capitalist and Democratic donor, who said that many of the contributors involved have worked together for decades.
Mr. Patricof said the goal was finding candidates with a “high probability of prevailing” in NovemberPaperwork to form the House Victory Project was filed last month with the Federal Election Commission and it listed 10 initial Democratic House candidates: Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey; Jason Crow of Colorado; Susie Lee of Nevada; Brad Ashford of Nebraska; Angie Craig of Minnesota; Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida; Elissa Slotkin of Michigan; Elaine Luria of Virginia; and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona.",fake

The 6o’s??? A fifty-year-old accusation!The refreshing thing is that most of the comments from the Palo Alto Daily Post are against Kniss. Our favorite comment makes a GREAT point:Does this mean the City of Palo Alto will be changing how it handles complaints by employees of sexual harassment? That somebody can make an allegation without any corroboration or witnesses, and it will be enough to fire an employee?

589,20-Oct-18,"Loretta Lynch was nothing but a puppet for Obama’s radical agenda. Lord knows she believes in the same backwards paranoia that minorities are still victims of pretty much everything. From her belief that voter ID is racist to her belief that minority youth are disciplined more often than other students (see video below). In her mind, she is still battling the racism of the 60’s…always the victim. It’s how she rolls…Remember right after Trump was elected she said there will be blood in the streets? Think about it…that’s supposedly our “top cop” saying that!Fast forward and she just made the claim that  voter ID laws “scare people”:“It has always been about power. It has always been about who gets to control the life of this country and who gets to determine how we all live our lives. That’s what it’s always been about, and so the more people you have coming into the electorate, the more you dilute the current power structure.”“This is not just a right, it’s a birthright. This is something that every American is entitled to by virtue of being here and being a citizen. And frankly, the people who are in power who have taken an oath to uphold this Constitution set themselves up and try and restrict it is really disgraceful. And that’s the real problem that we’re seeing here as well. To say that you don’t want to intimidate people is great. But look, these laws are designed to intimidate. Restricting early voting is designed to intimidate. The voter ID laws are designed to scare people away from the process.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Should we deduce that showing ID to get food stamps, open a bank account, buy liquor, rent or buy a house, rent a car, get on an airplane, get married or buy a gun would be “intimidating” or “scare” you too?The video below is a must watch to learn about what the former attorney general and the Obama adminstration thought about  voter ID and zero tolerance programs. It’s an US vs. THEM attitude…Not good!She claims people are trying to change voting rights so people can’t vote…Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch has to be the most racist and biased attorney general in our history. During her tenure as attorney general under Obama, she made a point to emphasize and promote leniency on black teens who misbehaved in school because she felt they were picked on. The video below is shocking and shows just how biased Lynch is. She had no business being the attorney general. It’s hard to top Eric Holder’s leftist policy but Lynch was able to do that with no problem. Listen to her talk about “our babies” – she means the minority youth she thinks are targeted for punishment.AG Loretta Lynch spoke about “our babies” (see video below) to a crowd during a speech on civil rights:“The dream is still continuing not only in the courts but in our schools,” Lynch told a largely black audience. “And we all know, education is the key. And we understand that discipline is important. We understand that rules are important but we also know that when we sit and look at schools that have the zero tolerance programs, they are often used, and they take our babies, minority children, black children, Hispanic children, and they put them out of school before they have a chance to learn.“And so the Department of Justice, this past year, has gone into the South, although we’re looking further, and brought the first prison, school-to-prison pipeline cases against school districts in Alabama.”She felt that young black men were unfairly disciplined more than other races. In other words, she feels that school discipline is racist. The problem is that they were punished more because they were committing more offenses. The government solution was to do what they always do…make the situation worse.TURNING A BLIND-EYE TO BAD BEHAVIOR BY MINORITY YOUTH:Via NY Post: The Trump administration plans this summer to scrap a controversial Obama-era discipline rule forced on schools to close racial gaps in suspensions and arrests but that critics say pressures educators to turn a blind eye to escalating bad behavior.The federal directive, issued jointly in 2014 by the US departments of Education and Justice, warned public school districts receiving federal funding — including New York City — that they could face investigation and funding cuts if they fail to reduce statistical “disparities” in discipline by race. On average, the administration noted, black students are suspended at three times the rate of their white peers.The directive also discourages student arrests and holds districts liable for the actions of “school resource officers … or other law enforcement personnel.”The one-size-fits-all federal policy, which recommends group counseling sessions and other alternatives to traditional discipline, has been foisted on several hundred school districts serving millions of students through investigations and threats of investigation that have continued into the Trump administration. More than 300 school districts remain under federal scrutiny, including NYC schools.“The scope of it is breathtaking,” said Max Eden, an education policy expert and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.Keep reading…Remember that our DOJ’s Loretta Lynch (Eric Holder in a skirt) pushed for a program to treat black students with more leniency than other students – in other words, school discipline is racist:

For those looking to leave the US, don’t come across the boarder, we have enough of our own problemsTHIS IS OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON BOOKER CALLING FOR THE LEFT TO “GET UP IN THE FACES OF SOME CONGRESSPEOPLE”:Standing in front of a crowd, Booker told the activists to “Get up in the face of some Congresspeople”Booker, who has been mentioned as a possible 2020 presidential election candidate, was speaking Wednesday at the National Conference on Ending Homelessness in Washington, D.C.He concluded his address by encouraging people not to be passive, and to instead “go to the Hill today.”“Please, get up in the face of some congresspeople,” he said.Last week, during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, the dishonest Senator from New Jersey referred to himself as “Spartacus”, after he threatened to release emails that were previously marked confidential. Booker threatened that the release of the confidential emails would be damning in nature and would hurt the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh.He was rebuked by Grassley and then Cornyn but then said, “Bring it, bring it”.Booker followed up that bravado with this comment: “This is about the closest I’ll probably ever have in my life to an, ‘I am Spartacus’ moment.”During his grandstanding moment, that was carefully orchestrated for the cameras, the 2020 presidential hopeful was warned by Senator Cornyn to not break the committee rules, and release the documents as Booker was threatening,  warning him that such an action could cause him to be removed from his position as a US Senator.Booker declared to the Senators in the room that he was prepared to lose his position for the breaking of rules: “I am, right now, before your process is finished — I am going to release the email about racial profiling. I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.”Soon after the grandstanding moment, Booker’s team released the documents.The fury over the documents led to a letdown for Democrats. The documents only demonstrated that in 2002, soon after the 9/11 attacks, Kavanaugh was against the racial profiling of people while working for the Bush White House. Kavanaugh told colleagues in the email that he favors “effective security measures that are race-neutral” for airports, and he is against “race-based” remedies for law enforcement in the aftermath of the attack. –Daily CallerNot only did the documents end up helping to boost the reputation of Judge Kavanaugh, but they also shined a light on the shameful theatrical nature of the carnival barker Democrat senator from New Jersey, aka “Spartacus of New Jersey”.Later in the evening, it was revealed that the documents Booker threatened to release had already been cleared for release and that the whole time, Booker was aware that they were no longer considered confidential.

For those looking to leave the US, don’t come across the boarder, we have enough of our own problemsTHIS IS OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON BOOKER CALLING FOR THE LEFT TO “GET UP IN THE FACES OF SOME CONGRESSPEOPLE”:Standing in front of a crowd, Booker told the activists to “Get up in the face of some Congresspeople”Booker, who has been mentioned as a possible 2020 presidential election candidate, was speaking Wednesday at the National Conference on Ending Homelessness in Washington, D.C.He concluded his address by encouraging people not to be passive, and to instead “go to the Hill today.”“Please, get up in the face of some congresspeople,” he said.Last week, during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, the dishonest Senator from New Jersey referred to himself as “Spartacus”, after he threatened to release emails that were previously marked confidential. Booker threatened that the release of the confidential emails would be damning in nature and would hurt the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh.He was rebuked by Grassley and then Cornyn but then said, “Bring it, bring it”.Booker followed up that bravado with this comment: “This is about the closest I’ll probably ever have in my life to an, ‘I am Spartacus’ moment.”During his grandstanding moment, that was carefully orchestrated for the cameras, the 2020 presidential hopeful was warned by Senator Cornyn to not break the committee rules, and release the documents as Booker was threatening,  warning him that such an action could cause him to be removed from his position as a US Senator.Booker declared to the Senators in the room that he was prepared to lose his position for the breaking of rules: “I am, right now, before your process is finished — I am going to release the email about racial profiling. I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.”Soon after the grandstanding moment, Booker’s team released the documents.The fury over the documents led to a letdown for Democrats. The documents only demonstrated that in 2002, soon after the 9/11 attacks, Kavanaugh was against the racial profiling of people while working for the Bush White House. Kavanaugh told colleagues in the email that he favors “effective security measures that are race-neutral” for airports, and he is against “race-based” remedies for law enforcement in the aftermath of the attack. –Daily CallerNot only did the documents end up helping to boost the reputation of Judge Kavanaugh, but they also shined a light on the shameful theatrical nature of the carnival barker Democrat senator from New Jersey, aka “Spartacus of New Jersey”.Later in the evening, it was revealed that the documents Booker threatened to release had already been cleared for release and that the whole time, Booker was aware that they were no longer considered confidential.

But one of the less meme-worthy moments of their discussion was the 41-year-old musician’s reference to his own mental health — specifically, his own alleged misdiagnosis.“I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder,” West said, referring to a condition he first opened up about in June. “I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and NFL. He looked at my brain; he put on three prongs … and he said I wasn’t actually bipolar; I had sleep deprivation.”The comment was a major departure from West’s previous discussions of bipolar disorder, in which he has called it his “superpower.”West didn’t say when he received the new explanation about his behavior issues, but he went on to say that the neuropsychologist he saw told him that lack of sleep was dangerous. “[He said] it could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now where I wouldn’t even remember my son’s name,” West told Trump. “So all this power that I got and I’m taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn’t be able to remember his name from a misdiagnosis.”",fake

No doubt. To win in a Republican primary around the country you have to really embrace the president’s policies and condone his behavior.

We have to. Anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy.”Flake admitted that he’d like to stay another term, but just couldn’t find a way to get along with President Trump. It should be noted, that the Republican Senator was able to get along perfectly fine with Barack Obama, the President whose stated goal was the fundamental transformation of America…“I never did warm to the president, in the campaign or as he governed,” said Flake. “These days, you not only have to embrace the president, you have to embrace all of his politics and his behavior in order to get through a Republican primary.

Cathy Areu gave the lowdown on what’s going to happen. It’s an effort to stop judicial nominations and confirmations like the one that just took place. The mobs couldn’t stop Kavanaugh so now the left is trying witchcraft. Only the left would think like this.Speaking of Brooklyn…The leftists love the new “Pee on Me” statues of President Trump used to curb your dog and show disrespect for our president all at the same time.As if it’s possible for the left to go any lower. Brooklyn, NY streets are now littered with statuettes of President Trump with a sign encouraging dogs (or humans?) to urinate on the statue. While the leftists think this is funny and perfectly ok, most people who have even an ounce of civility will think it’s disgusting. This is obviously in reference to the bogus Russian dossier that claimed that President Trump asked prostitutes to urinate on a hotel bed since President Obama had stayed in the same room. This only makes the left look like the low budget goons they are…Keep it up! November is coming!There is a ‘Pee On Me’ sign at the base of the statue with a small mention of the creator Porcupine Armadillo.   Phil Gable is the creator and discussed with Gothamist his inspiration for trashing our president:It was partly a public service. As a dog owner, I know people get understandably annoyed when dogs pee on their flower beds. But a dog’s instinct to pee where another dog has previously peed is quite strong. They need positive places to pee. If you reward them enough for peeing in appropriate places, that’s the best way to keep them from peeing in places that annoy people. So I sprayed the whole thing down with a dog potty-training aid to make it attractive to initial users. I think we’ll have critical mass very soon.Gable discussed how his disdain for President Trump inspired the ‘Pee On Me’ creations:And it was largely just a personal expression of my own disdain for Donald Trump, both as a President and a human being. I find it cathartic anytime I can express disdain through comedy, especially if it’s related to politics. And this case, it’s both funny and useful, which makes me happy. I know this isn’t a grand gesture of protest. He’s not going to hear about dogs peeing on a tiny statue of him and just say “That’s it. Now, I’m stepping down.” But everybody has their own way of dealing with things. For some it’s marching. For me, it’s humor and satire. Sometimes it’s a video, sometimes it’s on stage, and this time it happened to be a weird little art project. And I felt like this week was a particularly disturbing one in the ongoing shit show that is the 45th Presidency, so it seemed like a good time to find a new, funny way to express the disgust that so many of us feel.While I was setting it up, one woman came by with her two daughters. They really liked it—they took pictures with it, and she thanked me and said “This is the kind of thing that makes me love Brooklyn.” And being near people who appreciate this kind of thing on that kind of level makes me feel a little more hopeful.Gable is making more of these disgusting things and plans to keep placing them on Brooklyn streets. Gable explained why he did an older Trump before but will produce an older-looking version next: “I went with the younger-looking Trump because I think that’s probably how he sees himself, especially when he’s paying Russian escorts for golden showers…”Hurry up November!",fake

The prisoners have been convicted of crimes that don’t warrant sentences of more than a year, such as driving under the influence, drug possession, domestic violence, and car theft.The first thing one notices about Tent City is the proliferation of pink.

618,11-Oct-18,"Arnold Schwarzenegger used to joke that only “girlie men” opposed energetic capitalism and traditional American values. But now, the former bodybuilder, Hollywood star, and California governor is apologizing for popularizing the phrase.Schwarzenegger once made a name for himself with his he-man political style, making fun of his opponents as weaklings who could not lead.At least as early as 2004 Schwarzenegger called California Democrats “girlie men” and noted that in the next election the GOP would “terminate” them.Watch Schwarzenegger bring down the house at the 2004 RNC convention when he told the audience, “Don’t be an economic girlie man!”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]These amusing taunts and his strongman persona eventually led Schwarzenegger to the governor’s mansion in California.But since the day he took over as the Golden State’s chief executive Schwarzenegger slowly but surely started straying from the very style that so enthused his supporters. And now it seems that the “Governator” has completely abandoned his masculine terminology.In a new interview with Men’s Health magazine, Schwarzenegger is abjectly apologetic over his “girlie men” taunt.“At the time it felt like the right thing to do. It was in my gut. I improvised it. I called them girlie men because they weren’t willing to take risks,” the actor told the magazine.“They were afraid of everything,” he explained. “Politicians, in general, want to do little things, so there’s no risk involved.”But, today there are regrets. Schwarzenegger now says his rhetoric was counterproductive. “It was shortsighted. In the long term, it’s better to not say that, because you want to work with them.” –Breitbart NewsTwenty-one years ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger fathered a child with his housekeeper while married to Maria Shriver.Arnold Schwarzenegger told People Magazine that he’s still working to put the mistake behind him.Mistake?Here’s a picture of Schwarzenegger’s “mistake”, Joseph Baena, 20 years later. Perhaps Schwarzenegger should worry less about using the term “girlie men” and think about using the term “mistake” to describe a young 20-year-old man who grew up with out a father.“You do think about it every so often,” The Celebrity Apprentice host reveals in Men’s Journal, adding, “And I can beat myself up as much as I want — it’s not gonna change the situation. So the key thing is, how do you move forward? How do you have a great relationship with your kids?”The affair came to light the day after he left the California governor’s office in 2011. In a therapy session with his wife Maria Shriver and their four children, the actor confirmed he fathered a son with their maid Mildred Baena. Their child, Joseph, was 14 at the time. Shriver filed for divorce shortly after the revelation. ",fake

Bredesen is running in a close race against Marsha Blackburn for U.S. Senate. Stewart says Bredesen lied about his comment that he would vote for Brett Kavanaugh. His staff says it was a “political” move to “fool voters”.The race is very tight and we honestly can’t believe it! Blackburn is a solid candidate while Bredesen has a checkered political past:OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON PHIL BREDESEN:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The latest poll on the Senate race between Marsha Blackburn and the former governor of Tennessee just came out…Blackburn opened up an 8 point lead! This is a stunning development for so many reasons. One big reason is that pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Phil Bredesen so you’d think it would give him a boost in the polls, right? Well, Bredesen isn’t leading in the polls for the first time! Looks like this endorsement backfired!Gateway Pundit reports:Real Clear Politics had Bredesen leading through most of the year, right up until around the time the Kavanaugh hearings started. Until late September, Bredesen was up by a few percentage points. Then another poll in late September and early October showed Blackburn up by 5 points. And now a week later she’s extending her lead.Yes, it could be that once Swift endorsed the former governor, voters decided to stand up for Blackburn. It could also be the visit to Tennessee by President Trump last week.Could people be looking into the candidates more closely?They might have uncovered what we did about Phil Bredesen. Our previous report on Bredesen reveals things that most voters would be shocked at. It involves sexual assault and shredding evidence!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON TAYLOR SWIFT’S ENDORSEMENT OF BREDESEN AND THE CHECKERED POLITICAL PAST OF THE FORMER GOVERNOR:Taylor Swift thinks we care about who she endorses…we don’t. Why would we ask a pop star for advice on politics? We might ask her to sing or write a song but we’d never consider asking her for political advice. We think most people feel the same way but Taylor Swift lives in the world of Hollywood political self-importance. She just came out with a political endorsement on INSTAGRAM for the Democrat running for US Senate in Tennessee.  The problem is she doesn’t know what she’s talking about (see below). Don’t you love it when pop singers play political activist? It exposes them for the clueless hacks they are.Bet she doesn’t know this…Here’s a little more from WFB on the candidate Swift endorsed:Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen, a top party recruit who announced his Senate campaign on Thursday morning, was criticized for hiding details of sexual assault investigations into his top officials during his tenure as the state’s governor.Yes, the Democrat Swift endorsed has some problems…The WFB went on to report that documents related to sexual harassment during Bredesen’s tenure were shredded. The Tennesseean and the AP both investigated and found something fishy was going on:“The governor’s office has become involved in a select number of workplace harassment complaints against top state officials and has put them under a veil of secrecy that does not apply to ordinary state workers, a Tennessean review of case files shows,” the paper wrote in July 2005 after finding that shredding of documents was common for investigations into officials at the level of Cooper and White.The AP, which conducted its own thorough review of workplace harassment in Bredesen’s office, came to a similar conclusion.“In a review last year of 602 workplace harassment case files across all levels of state government, the AP reported that documents were shredded only in high-profile cases,” the AP similarly found around the same time.On the other hand, Marsha Blackburn is squeaky clean. She’s a fantastic candidate with a strong conservative record.Support for Marsha has now grown because of Taylor Swift’s endorsement.

623,10-Oct-18,"During a rally in Erie, PA, tonight in a packed crowd and he’s not holding back. Trump is LIT and he just smashed Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) as a “pale shadow” of his late father, Bob Casey Sr., and suggesting that Casey Jr. values the lives of illegal immigrants more than the lives of American citizens.The Erie rally-goers also witnessed Trump stand by his commitment to the coal industry in PA, and then fired more shots right at Bob Casey, and made sure to mention that support was on the way down in Florida and any areas affected by Hurricane Michael.When it came to Bob Casey, Trump pointed out that Casey voted against the law created after Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal immigrant who was deported multiple times.Fox News provided the quotes:“Bob Casey even voted against Kate’s Law, named for Kate Steinle, who was gunned down by a five-time-deported illegal alien who should never have been in our country,” Trump said. The legislation, which is stalled in the Senate, would hike the penalties for illegal immigrants who attempt to re-enter the country. Casey has opposed it, saying the best solution is to focus on securing the border.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“Bob Casey puts criminal aliens ahead of U.S. citizens. Always has. … He’s banking on the name of his father,” Trump said. Casey’s father, who died in 2000, previously served as the state’s governor from 1987 to 1995.“I’m not sure I ever met Bob Casey,” Trump said. “Now, his father was a good man. Knew him a little bit. But we’re dealing with a totally different person. I don’t know this man.”“He’s not an obstructionist, he’s worse: He will do whatever Schumer, Pelosi, and the new star of the Democrat Party tells him to do,” Trump said, referring to Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. “Very low IQ,” Trump added.”President Trump had no problem calling out the people he dislikes and disagrees with. Trump called it like it is.Many have criticized President Trump for the way he calls people out and some have stated that it will not bring people together, but only cause a further divide.Those people need to look closer at the Democratic Party and what their supporters do on a regular basis.Violence, shaming people, and all their nonsense that drives the rest of the country mad is the reason that President Trump calls them out on it.If Democrats behaved like adults, then perhaps Trump wouldn’t call so many people out for the things that they do.Republicans are waiting for them to grow up – that’s just my observation, but I think many people would agree with it.Do you believe that Democrats and their party have fallen apart and are now resorting to childish behavior and often illegal acts to try and force their agenda on people?If anyone says the crowd was small, then don’t believe them.

629,08-Oct-18,"The latest poll on the Senate race between Marsha Blackburn and the former governor of Tennessee just came out…Blackburn opened up an 8 point lead! This is a stunning development for so many reasons. One big reason is that pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Phil Bredesen so you’d think it would give him a boost in the polls, right? Well, Bredesen isn’t leading in the polls for the first time! Looks like this endorsement backfired!Gateway Pundit reports:Real Clear Politics had Bredesen leading through most of the year, right up until around the time the Kavanaugh hearings started. Until late September, Bredesen was up by a few percentage points. Then another poll in late September and early October showed Blackburn up by 5 points. And now a week later she’s extending her lead.Yes, it could be that once Swift endorsed the former governor, voters decided to stand up for Blackburn. It could also be the visit to Tennessee by President Trump last week.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Could people be looking into the candidates more closely?They might have uncovered what we did about Phil Bredesen. Our previous report on Bredesen reveals things that most voters would be shocked at. It involves sexual assault and shredding evidence!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON MARSHA BLACKBURN’S OPPONENT:Taylor Swift thinks we care about who she endorses…we don’t. Why would we ask a pop star for advice on politics? We might ask her to sing or write a song but we’d never consider asking her for political advice. We think most people feel the same way but Taylor Swift lives in the world of Hollywood political self-importance. She just came out with a political endorsement on INSTAGRAM for the Democrat running for US Senate in Tennessee.  The problem is she doesn’t know what she’s talking about (see below). Don’t you love it when pop singers play political activist? It exposes them for the clueless hacks they are.Bet she doesn’t know this…Here’s a little more from WFB on the candidate Swift endorsed:Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen, a top party recruit who announced his Senate campaign on Thursday morning, was criticized for hiding details of sexual assault investigations into his top officials during his tenure as the state’s governor.Yes, the Democrat Swift endorsed has some problems…The WFB went on to report that documents related to sexual harassment during Bredesen’s tenure were shredded. The Tennesseean and the AP both investigated and found something fishy was going on:“The governor’s office has become involved in a select number of workplace harassment complaints against top state officials and has put them under a veil of secrecy that does not apply to ordinary state workers, a Tennessean review of case files shows,” the paper wrote in July 2005 after finding that shredding of documents was common for investigations into officials at the level of Cooper and White.The AP, which conducted its own thorough review of workplace harassment in Bredesen’s office, came to a similar conclusion.“In a review last year of 602 workplace harassment case files across all levels of state government, the AP reported that documents were shredded only in high-profile cases,” the AP similarly found around the same time.On the other hand, Marsha Blackburn is squeaky clean. She’s a fantastic candidate with a strong conservative record.Support for Marsha has now grown because of Taylor Swift’s endorsement.

631,08-Oct-18,"Benny Johnson from the Daily Caller shared a video of Kavanaugh protesters trying to break into the Supreme Court. The protesters were trying to stop the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh into the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh had faced sexual assault allegations from Christine Blasey Ford and several others. Ford’s story had no witnesses to support her claims, and those she named said it did not happen or they didn’t seem to know what she was talking about.Other claims that Kavanaugh acted inappropriate were unable to materialize into something credible and more or less brushed off, as accusers such as Julie Swetnick proved she was also not credible, nor did her story add up either.The accusations faced by Brett Kavanaugh smelled more like a Democrat plot to take his seat on the Supreme Court, a fight for power that could have an impact for decades. It was an “at any cost” battle between Republicans and Democrats, but Kavanaugh was victorious.The protesters did not want to face the loss and they are seen here trying to claw and punch their way into the United States Supreme Court.Of course, the doors are super thick, weight tons, and are of solid bronze according to Johnson.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Watch the video of the protesters attempting to get into, or better yet – break into, the Supreme Court.Hysterical Left-Wing protesters storming the 13 ton solid bronze doors of the Supreme Court and attempting to claw them open with their bare hands would be the funniest thing I've ever seen – if it was not simultaneously the scariest.Imagine if conservatives behaved like this? pic.twitter.com/0T2lasZn9E— Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 7, 2018“Hysterical Left-Wing protesters storming the 13 ton solid bronze doors of the Supreme Court and attempting to claw them open with their bare hands would be the funniest thing I’ve ever seen – if it was not simultaneously the scariest.Imagine if conservatives behaved like this?”Trying to “claw them open” could be considered an attempt to break in, although there’s no chance that any human could get through those doors with their bare hands.Johnson asked us to imagine if conservative people acted like this. I’m not sure what would happen. Maybe people would get arrested and the mainstream media outlets with a liberal-leaning would focus on the behavior.It seems like the more radical and extreme behavior comes from the left side of politics.That’s quite a shame because no one should be acting like this.Everyone who is a legal citizen and of age to vote should use their vote as their voice.If anyone is upset with how the government is run, then those people have the ability to get involved with local branches of their government.We all have the power and ability to make a difference with our votes, our volunteering, our participation, and our will to do a good job.Banging on doors and trying to claw them open is not a good example.What did those people banging on the door of Supreme Court accomplish?Nothing, right?Here’s more coverage of the situation during Kavanaugh’s confirmation day.https://twitter.com/TAPAlerts/status/1048691766914945024A large crowd of protesters has surged onto the front steps of the US #SupremeCourt, chanting, ""#Kavanaugh has got to go.""

Two and half years ago Quinn took issue with a Central HS student’s column critical of college race protests going on at the time.Last month, Quinn was selected as The Philadelphia Citizen’s “Citizen of the Week” for his voter registration advocacy. “As a politics and U.S. government teacher—for the last 10 years at Central—Quinn is uniquely poised to push the message of voting to his students.”DiGiorgio has called for an investigation into who was responsible for the flyers.

The purge of conservatives continues unabated on social media (and yes, it was because I posted a sarcastic remark about Democrats).The offending tweet was included in the email from Twitter Support. It is attached below for your reference.The good news, I guess, is that liberals (Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, is an unabashed ultra-liberal) are now closer to their nirvana of a world without criticism or opposition.The bad news is they will inevitably be next.The reason I’m sending this to you is that, liberal or conservative, I know every single one of you agrees that this muzzle on free speech is a cancer that, if allowed to metastasize, will destroy this nation and everything it stands for.Please feel free to share this email.",fake

643,05-Oct-18,"Senator Susan Collins of Maine delivered a speech for the ages today. It wasn’t fiery or snarky but a speech that literally went point by point to make the case for why she will vote yes for Judge Kavanaugh. She admonished the left and those who put politics before everything else. She went on to explain why on every major issue she felt Judge Kavanaugh was a fair judge. It was well thought out and serious. She concluded her speech with more admonishment for those who used Christine Blasey Ford and the #MeToo movement for political purposes. She was fantastic! The video and transcript are below:SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS:Mr. President, the five previous times that I have come to the floor to explain my vote on the nomination of a justice to the United States Supreme Court, I have begun my floor remarks explaining my decision with a recognition of the solemn nature and the importance of the occasion.But today we have come to the conclusion of a confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature of a gutter-level political campaign than a solemn occasion.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The President nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July 9th.  Within moments of that announcement, special interest groups raced to be the first to oppose him, including one organization that didn’t even bother to fill in the Judge’s name on its pre-written press release – they simply wrote that they opposed “Donald Trump’s nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States.” A number of Senators joined the race to announce their opposition, but they were beaten to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition before the nominee’s identity was even known.Since that time, we have seen special interest groups whip their followers into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentations and outright falsehoods about Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial record.  Over-the-top rhetoric and distortions of his record and testimony at his first hearing produced short-lived headlines which, although debunked hours later, continue to live on and be spread through social media.  Interest groups have also spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination.Our Supreme Court confirmation process has been in steady decline for more than thirty years.  One can only hope that the Kavanaugh nomination is where the process has finally hit rock bottom.Against this backdrop, it is up to each individual Senator to decide what the Constitution’s “advice and consent” duty means.  Informed by Alexander Hamilton’s Federalist 76, I have interpreted this to mean that the President has broad discretion to consider a nominee’s philosophy, whereas my duty as a Senator is to focus on the nominee’s qualifications as long as that nominee’s philosophy is within the mainstream of judicial thought.I have always opposed litmus tests for judicial nominees with respect to their personal views or politics, but I fully expect them to be able to put aside any and all personal preferences in deciding the cases that come before them.  I have never considered the President’s identity or party when evaluating Supreme Court nominations.  As a result, I voted in favor of Justices Roberts and Alito, who were nominated by President Bush, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, who were nominated by President Obama, and Justice Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump.So I began my evaluation of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination by reviewing his 12-year record on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, including his more than 300 opinions and his many speeches and law review articles.  Nineteen attorneys, including lawyers from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, briefed me many times each week and assisted me in evaluating the judge’s extensive record.  I met with Judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my office.  I listened carefully to the testimony at the Committee hearings.  I spoke with people who knew him personally, such as Condoleezza Rice and many others.  And, I talked with Judge Kavanaugh a second time by phone for another hour to ask him very specific additional questions.I have also met with thousands of my constituents, both advocates and many opponents, regarding Judge Kavanaugh.  One concern that I frequently heard was that Judge Kavanaugh would be likely to eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) vital protections for people with preexisting conditions.  I disagree with this contention.  In a dissent in Seven-Sky v. Holder, Judge Kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the ACA on narrow procedural grounds, preserving the law in full.  Many experts have said his dissent informed Justice Roberts’ opinion upholding the ACA at the Supreme Court.Furthermore, Judge Kavanaugh’s approach toward the doctrine of severability is narrow.  When a part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds, he has argued for severing the invalid clause as surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain intact.This was his approach in his dissent in a case that involved a challenge to the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (PPH v. CFPB).  In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh argued for “severing any problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.”  Given the current challenges to the ACA, proponents, including myself, of protections for people with pre-existing conditions should want a Justice who would take just this kind of approach.Another assertion I have heard often is that Judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the President were to come before the Court.  The basis for this argument seems to be two-fold.  First, Judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes that Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution or civil liability while in office.  Mr. President, I believe opponents miss the mark on this issue.  The fact that Judge Kavanaugh offered this legislative proposal suggests that he believes that the President does not have such protection currently.Second, there are some who argue that given the current Special Counsel investigation, President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate a justice.  That argument ignores our recent history.  President Clinton, in 1993, nominated Justice Ginsburg after the Whitewater investigation was already underway.  And she was confirmed 96-3.  The next year, just three months after Independent Counsel Robert Fiske was named to lead the Whitewater investigation, President Clinton nominated Justice Breyer.  He was confirmed 87-9.Supreme Court Justices have not hesitated to rule against the presidents who have nominated them.  Perhaps most notably in United States v. Nixon, three Nixon appointees who heard the case joined the unanimous opinion against him.Judge Kavanaugh has been unequivocal in his belief that no president is above the law.  He has stated that Marbury v. Madison, Youngstown Steel v. Sawyer and United States v. Nixon are three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases in history.  What do they have in common?  Each of them is a case where the Court served as a check on presidential power.  And I would note that the fourth case that Judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as the greatest in history was Brown v Board of Education.One Kavanaugh decision illustrates the  point about the check on presidential power directly.  He wrote the opinion in Hamdan v. United States, a case that challenged the Bush Administration’s military commission prosecution of an associate of Osama Bin Laden.  This conviction was very important to the Bush Administration, but Judge Kavanaugh, who had been appointed to the DC Circuit by President Bush and had worked in President Bush’s White House, ruled that the conviction was unlawful.  As he explained during the hearing, “We don’t make decisions based on who people are, or their policy preferences, or the moment.  We base decisions on the law….”Others I met with have expressed concerns that Justice Kennedy’s retirement threatens the right of same sex couples to marry.  Yet, Judge Kavanaugh described the Obergefell decision, which legalized same gender marriages, as an important landmark precedent.  He also cited Justice Kennedy’s recent Masterpiece Cakeshop opinion for the Court’s majority stating that: “The days of treating gay and lesbian Americans or gay and lesbian couples as second-class citizens who are inferior in dignity and worth are over in the Supreme Court.”Others have suggested that the judge holds extreme views on birth control.  In one case, Judge Kavanaugh incurred the disfavor of both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the involvement of employers with religious objections.  Although his critics frequently overlook this point, Judge Kavanaugh’s dissent rejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception.  In fact, he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent “strongly suggested” that there was a “compelling interest” in facilitating access to birth control.There has also been considerable focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that Judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Protecting this right is important to me.To my knowledge, Judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee to express the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition, but rooted in Article III of our Constitution itself.  He believes that precedent “is not just a judicial policy … it is constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay heed to rules of precedent.”  In other words, precedent isn’t a goal or an aspiration; it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances.The judge further explained that precedent provides stability, predictability, reliance, and fairness.  There are, of course, rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court would rightly overturn a precedent.  The most famous example was when the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, correcting a “grievously wrong” decision–to use the judge’s term–allowing racial inequality.  But, someone who believes that the importance of precedent has been rooted in the Constitution would follow long-established precedent except in those rare circumstances where a decision is “grievously wrong” or “deeply inconsistent with the law.”  Those are Judge Kavanaugh’s phrases.As Judge Kavanaugh asserted to me, a long-established precedent is not something to be trimmed, narrowed, discarded, or overlooked.  Its roots in the Constitution give the concept of stare decisis greater weight such that precedent can’t be trimmed or narrowed simply because a judge might want to on a whim.  In short, his views on honoring precedent would preclude attempts to do by stealth that which one has committed not to do overtly.Noting that Roe v. Wade was decided 45 years ago, and reaffirmed 19 years later in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, I asked Judge Kavanaugh whether the passage of time is relevant to following precedent.  He said decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence.Our discussion then turned to the right of privacy, on which the Supreme Court relied in Griswold v. Connecticut, a case that struck down a law banning the use and sale of contraceptives.  Griswold established the legal foundation that led to Roe eight years later.  In describing Griswold as “settled law,” Judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct application of two famous cases from the 1920s, Meyer and Pierce, that are not seriously challenged by anyone today.  Finally, in his testimony, he noted repeatedly that Roe had been upheld by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, describing it as “precedent on precedent.”  When I asked him would it be sufficient to overturn a long-established precedent if five current justices believed it was wrongly decided, he emphatically said “no.”Opponents frequently cite then-candidate Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to nominate only judges who would overturn Roe.  The Republican platform for all presidential campaigns has included this pledge since at least 1980.  During this time, Republican presidents have appointed Justices O’Connor, Souter, and Kennedy to the Supreme Court.  These are the very three justices—Republican president appointed justices—who authored the Casey decision, which reaffirmed Roe.  Furthermore, pro-choice groups vigorously opposed each of these justices’ nominations.  Incredibly, they even circulated buttons with the slogan “Stop Souter Or Women Will Die!”  Just two years later, Justice Souter coauthored the Casey opinion, reaffirming a woman’s right to choose.  Suffice it to say, prominent advocacy organizations have been wrong.These same interest groups have speculated that Judge Kavanaugh was selected to do the bidding of conservative ideologues, despite his record of judicial independence.  I asked the judge point blank whether he had made any commitments or pledges to anyone at the White House, to the Federalist Society, or to any outside group on how he would decide cases.  He unequivocally assured me he had not.Judge Kavanaugh has received rave reviews for his 12-year track record as a judge, including for his judicial temperament.  The American Bar Association (ABA) gave him its highest possible rating.  Its Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary conducted an extraordinarily thorough assessment, soliciting input from almost 500 people, including his judicial colleagues.  The ABA concluded that “his integrity, judicial temperament, and professional competence met the highest standard.”Lisa Blatt, who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman in history, testified: “By any objective measure, Judge Kavanaugh is clearly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.”  “His opinions are invariably thoughtful and fair….”  Ms. Blatt, who clerked for and is an ardent admirer of Justice Ginsburg, and who is, in her own words, “an unapologetic defender of a woman’s right to choose,” said that Judge Kavanaugh “fit[s] in the mainstream of legal thought.”  She also observed that “Judge Kavanaugh is remarkably committed to promoting women in the legal profession.”That Judge Kavanaugh is more of a centrist than some of his critics maintain is reflected in the fact that he and Chief Judge Merrick Garland voted the same way in 93 percent of the cases that they heard together.  Indeed, Chief Judge Garland joined in more than 96 percent of the majority opinions authored by Judge Kavanaugh, dissenting only once.Despite all this, after weeks of reviewing Judge Kavanaugh’s record and listening to 32 hours of his testimony, the Senate’s advice and consent role was thrown into a tailspin following the allegations of sexual assault by Professor Christine Blasey Ford.  The confirmation process now involves evaluating whether or not Judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault, and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee.Some argue that because this is a lifetime appointment to our highest court, the public interest requires that doubts be resolved against the nominee.  Others see the public interest as embodied in our long-established tradition of affording to those accused of misconduct a presumption of innocence.  In cases in which the facts are unclear, they would argue that the question should be resolved in favor of the nominee.Mr. President, I understand both viewpoints.  This debate is complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a trial.  But certain fundamental legal principles—about due process, the presumption of innocence, and fairness—do bear on my thinking, and I cannot abandon them.In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be.  We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy.The presumption of innocence is relevant to the advice and consent function when an accusation departs from a nominee’s otherwise exemplary record.  I worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public faith in the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward.Some of the allegations levied against Judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important.  I am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by Professor Ford, but of the allegation that, when he was a teenager, Judge Kavanaugh drugged multiple girls and used their weakened state to facilitate gang rape.  This outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parroted public statements of others.  That such an allegation can find its way into the Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness.Mr. President, I listened carefully to Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony before the Judiciary Committee.  I found her testimony to be sincere, painful, and compelling.  I believe that she is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life.  Nevertheless, the four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events of that evening gathering where she says the assault occurred; none of the individuals Professor Ford says were at the party has any recollection at all of that night.Judge Kavanaugh forcefully denied the allegations under penalty of perjury.  Mark Judge denied under penalty of felony that he had witnessed an assault.  PJ Smyth, another person allegedly at the party, denied that he was there under penalty of felony.  Professor Ford’s life-long friend Leland Keyser indicated that, under penalty of felony, she does not remember that party.  And Ms. Keyser went further.  She indicated that not only does she not remember a night like that, but also that she does not even know Brett Kavanaugh.In addition to the lack of corroborating evidence, we also learned some facts that raised more questions.  For instance, since these allegations have become public, Professor Ford testified that not a single person has contacted her to say, “I was at the party that night.”Furthermore, the professor testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening, she knew that, because of the distance, she would have needed a ride – yet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the one that drove her home or were in the car with her that night.  And Professor Ford also indicated that even though she left that small gathering of six or so people abruptly and without saying goodbye and distraught, none of them called her the next day – or ever – to ask why she left – is she okay – not even her closest friend, Ms. Keyser.Mr. President, the Constitution does not provide guidance as to how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims.  It leaves that decision up to each Senator.  This is not a criminal trial, and I do not believe that claims such as these need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Nevertheless, fairness would dictate that the claims at least should meet a threshold of “more likely than not” as our standard.The facts presented do not mean that Professor Ford was not sexually assaulted that night – or at some other time – but they do lead me to conclude that the allegations fail to meet the “more likely than not” standard.  Therefore, I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the Court.Let me emphasize that my approach to this question should not be misconstrued as suggesting that unwanted sexual contact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country.  To the contrary, if any good at all has come from this ugly confirmation process, it has been to create an awareness that we have underestimated the pervasiveness of this terrible problem.I have been alarmed and disturbed, however, by some who have suggested that unless Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is rejected, the Senate is somehow condoning sexual assault.  Nothing could be further from the truth.Every person—man or woman–who makes a charge of sexual assault deserves to be heard and treated with respect.  The #MeToo movement is real.  It matters.  It is needed.  And it is long overdue. We know that rape and sexual assault are less likely to be reported to the police than other forms of assault.  On average, an estimated 211,000 rapes and sexual assaults go unreported every year. We must listen to survivors, and every day we must seek to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so many.  We owe this to ourselves, our children, and generations to come.Since the hearing, I have listened to many survivors of sexual assault.  Many were total strangers who told me their heart-wrenching stories for the first time in their lives.  Some were friends I have known for decades, yet with the exception of one woman who had confided in me years ago, I had no idea that they had been the victims of sexual attacks.  I am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward, and I hope that in heightening public awareness, they have also lightened the burden that they have been quietly bearing for so many years.  To them, I pledge to do all that I can to ensure that their daughters and granddaughters never share their experiences.Over the past few weeks, I have been emphatic that the Senate has an obligation to investigate and evaluate the serious allegations of sexual assault.  I called for and supported the additional hearing to hear from both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.  I also pushed for and supported the FBI supplemental background investigation.  This was the right thing to do.Christine Ford never sought the spotlight.  She indicated that she was terrified to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and she has shunned attention since then.  She seemed completely unaware of Chairman Grassley’s offer to allow her to testify confidentially in California.  Watching her, Mr. President, I could not help but feel that some people who wanted to engineer the defeat of this nomination cared little, if at all, for her well-being.Professor Ford testified that a very limited number of people had access to her letter.  Yet that letter found its way into the public domain.  She testified that she never gave permission for that very private letter to be released.  And yet, here we are.  We are in the middle of a fight that she never sought, arguing about claims that she wanted to raise confidentially.One theory I have heard espoused repeatedly is that our colleague, Senator Feinstein, leaked Professor Ford’s letter at the eleventh hour to derail this process.  I want to state this very clearly: I know Senator Diane Feinstein extremely well, and I believe that she would never do that.  I knew that to be the case before she even stated it at the hearing.  She is a person of integrity, and I stand by her.I have also heard some argue that the Chairman of the Committee somehow treated Professor Ford unfairly.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Chairman Grassley, along with his excellent staff, treated Professor Ford with compassion and respect throughout the entire process.  And that is the way the Senator from Iowa has conducted himself throughout a lifetime dedicated to public service.But the fact remains, Mr. President, that someone leaked this letter against Professor Ford’s express wishes.  I suspect, regrettably, that we will never know for certain who did it.  To that leaker, who I hope is listening now, let me say that what you did was unconscionable.  You have taken a survivor who was not only entitled to your respect, but who also trusted you to protect her – and you have sacrificed her well-being in a misguided attempt to win whatever political crusade you think you are fighting.  My only hope is that your callous act has turned this process into such a dysfunctional circus that it will cause the Senate – and indeed all Americans – to reconsider how we evaluate Supreme Court nominees.  If that happens, then the appalling lack of compassion you afforded Professor Ford will at least have some unintended positive consequences.Mr. President, the politically charged atmosphere surrounding this nomination had reached a fever pitch even before these allegations were known, and it has been challenging even then to separate fact from fiction.We live in a time of such great disunity, as the bitter fight over this nomination both in the Senate and among the public clearly demonstrates.  It is not merely a case of different groups having different opinions.  It is a case of people bearing extreme ill will toward those who disagree with them.  In our intense focus on our differences, we have forgotten the common values that bind us together as Americans.  When some of our best minds are seeking to develop ever more sophisticated algorithms designed to link us to websites that only reinforce and cater to our views, we can only expect our differences to intensify.This would have alarmed the drafters of our Constitution, who were acutely aware that different values and interests could prevent Americans from becoming and remaining a single people.  Indeed, of the six objectives they invoked in the preamble to the Constitution, the one that they put first was the formation of “a more perfect Union.”Their vision of “a more perfect Union” does not exist today, and if anything, we appear to be moving farther away from it.  It is particularly worrisome that the Supreme Court, the institution that most Americans see as the principal guardian of our shared constitutional heritage, is viewed as part of the problem through a political lens.Mr. President, we’ve heard a lot of charges and counter charges about Judge Kavanaugh.  But as those who have known him best have attested, he has been an exemplary public servant, judge, teacher, coach, husband, and father.  Despite the turbulent, bitter fight surrounding his nomination, my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5-4 decisions and so that public confidence in our Judiciary and our highest court is restored.  Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.",fake
644,05-Oct-18,"Democrats are panicked. Hillary lost and President Trump’s second pick for the Supreme Court is about to be nominated.Never, in the history of the United States of America, have we witnessed a President like Donald J. Trump. When it comes to defending the promise he made to make America great again, he’s not backing down, and it’s literally driving Democrats to the edge.But it’s the attacks by Democrat women against Republican men, that is startling. It all with Donald Trump’s inauguration, and the subsequent Women’s March in DC, where celebrities like Madonna addressed large crowds of liberal women, telling them how she’s “dreamed of blowing up the White House”. For the most part, the media ignored the threatening behavior of female Democrat activists…after all, it was Donald Trump, and he probably deserved it.The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad.

Many on the Left cheered—every day Americans were stunned.In June, Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters (CA) called on her supporters to confront members of Trump’s administration wherever they go. Since that time, several incidents of Trump supporters being confronted by activists have been reported.Last week, Democrat activists ran Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) out of a DC restaurant where he was dining with his wife Heidi. The activists, who were mostly women, cited Cruz’s support for Judge Kavanaugh for the reason behind their thuggish behavior.Republican Senator Jeff Flake (AZ) was confronted in an elevator last week by an illegal alien, who works for George Soros, as a shame him into voting against the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Yesterday, Elaina Plott, a writer for The Atlantic,  took to Twitter to inform her followers that the liberal Republican Senator Jeff Flake, was still “having issues” with the Kavanaugh vote, citing a discussion she had with Democrat Senator Coons, who claims Flake asked if they could “speak at length later”.Annie Shields, who works for the far-left “The Nation”, responded to Plott’s tweet, by threatening Senator Flake by admitting that she’s starting a “National @DemSocialists working group to follow Jeff Flake around to every restaurant, cafe, store, etc he goes to for the rest of his life and yell at him.”https://twitter.com/anastasiakeeley/status/1047930583777779714Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein (CA) may be 85 years old, but that didn’t stop her from cornering and bullying fellow Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) into voting “no” on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, for Feinstein, her thuggish behavior was captured by a photographer.Yesterday, Hollywood activists and former comedians Rosie O’Donnell and Kathy Griffin, whose career ended when she held a bloodied and decapitated head of President Trump up for cameras, tweeted about their hate for Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (SC), over his support for Judge Kavanaugh. In their tweets, the Hollywood activists suggested that he’s a closet gay man and that he has sex with animals.Threatening behavior by Democrat activists is not limited to attacks on Judge Kavanaugh supporters.Conservative Rep. Mike Bishop (R-MI), who’s running for re-election against Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat who was hand-picked by Nancy Pelosi, has seen his share of threatening behavior by female activists.Last week, while Bishop met with a group of homeschoolers in a local church in his district, protesters waited outside to confront him and follow him to his car.  Mike Bishop was recently confronted at the Detroit Metro airport. The aggressive confrontations didn’t stop at the gate, once Bishop got on the plane, one of the women, who actually boarded the plane, waited until the plane left the jetway and confronted him again on the plane, sticking her phone in his face and screaming at him.How is this threatening behavior by female liberal activists okay with members of their own Party?The woman pictured below was part of a group of protesters who followed Mike Bishop out of a City Hall meeting and surrounded his car so he couldn’t leave the parking lot.Here is the female agitator again, blocking Bishop’s vehicle from leaving the City Hall in his hometown of Rochester, MIEver since Mike Bishop’s Democrat opponent, Elissa Slotkin entered the race against him, he’s been confronted by leftist activists.Slotkin, a former CIA agent whose nomination by Barack Obama to become the assistant defense secretary for international security affairs, was struck down by Senator McCain, who called her “unqualified” and a liar, is no stranger to bullying innocent people. During a recent town hall meeting in Bishop’s hometown of Rochester, MI, Slotkin pointed out that many businesses in the downtown area had signs supporting her Republican opponent in their front windows. Democrat Congressional candidate Elissa Slotkin then asked the Rochester citizens to boycott the businesses who openly supported her Republican opponent. According to Congressman Mike Bishop, many of the businesses who Slotkin called out for supporting Bishop, received multiple threats following Slotkin’s calls to boycott them.The unidentified woman (pictured below) followed Congressman Mike Bishop around all day with a camera, while he took part in a local parade. She then followed Bishop to his car. Other than threatening him, what’s the point of her spending her day following him with a camera?Had a great day in Holly yesterday. My opponent was not there, but she was kind enough to send hecklers. This nice person actually followed me through the entire parade and then back to my car. #desperationPosted by Mike Bishop on Sunday, September 9, 2018Debbie Schlussel, the woman who lied about being sexually assaulted by Fox News host Sean Hannity, confronted Congressman Bishop at a local grocery store.According to Bishop, a local Meijer store manager was forced to escort Schlussel from the grocery store, after she followed Bishop around the store, screaming at him.  A couple of days later, Schlussel appeared in a park in Bishop’s hometown where he was spending time with his wife and kids. According to Bishop, she began following him around and screaming obscenities at him.Are these vile attacks by women against Congressman Bishop coordinated by his opponent, Democrat Elissa Slotkin? And should Americans just accept that this is the way Democrats are going to behave from now on, or will Democrats start paying the ultimate price at the polls?To donate to Mike Bishop’s campaign, please go HERE.And more…Yesterday, Democrat actress Molly Ringwald essentially called half of America “rapists”.

648,05-Oct-18,"In a damning statement, that called her story into question, Leland Keyser, who Ford claimed was a close friend, said that she not only does not remember the house party where the alleged incident took place over 36 years ago but that she also has never even met Brett Kavanaugh.Breitbart News reported that a relative of Keyser claims she felt that during her Senate testimony, Dr. Ford threw her friend under the bus.What Ford told the committee about Keyser struck many as an attempt by Ford to attack her friend with the claim that Keyser would remember the incident if her health were not so bad, or that her health struggles forced her to lie because she does not have the strength, to tell the truth. Here is what Ford said:Leland has significant health challenges, and I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs, and she let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her, and she texted me right afterward with an apology and good wishes, and et cetera. So I’m glad that she’s taking care of herself.I don’t expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening. It was a very unremarkable party. It was not one of their more notorious parties because nothing remarkable happened to them that evening. They were downstairs.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]As attorneys for Christine Ford Blasey demanded an FBI investigation over the last two weeks, the Wall Street Journal reports that her allies were pressuring one witness to change her story. Ford named Leland Keyser as one of four potential witnesses to the Washington Post, but once her name became public, Keyser issued a statement through her attorneys that she cannot recall ever being at a party with Brett Kavanaugh. –Hot AirA friend of Christine Blasey Ford told FBI investigators that she felt pressured by Dr. Ford’s allies to revisit her initial statement that she knew nothing about an alleged sexual assault by a teenage Brett Kavanaugh, which she later updated to say that she believed but couldn’t corroborate Dr. Ford’s account, according to people familiar with the matter.Leland Keyser, who Dr. Ford has said was present at the gathering where she was allegedly assaulted in the 1980s, told investigators that Monica McLean, a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and a friend of Dr. Ford’s, had urged her to clarify her statement, the people said. …On Thursday, a day after sending to the White House the report on its investigation into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, the FBI sent the White House and Senate an additional package of information that included text messages from Ms. McLean to Ms. Keyser, according to a person familiar with the matter.Watch:The Conservative Treehouse does a brilliant job of breaking down the ties to Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford and her former FBI agent friend Monical L. McLean, who Leyland Keyser claims was pressuring her to change her story about Kavanaugh.In a letter released from a former boyfriend of Christine Blasey-Ford, there was a name curiously not redacted. The name of Monica L McLean was revealed as a life-long friend who Ms. Ford helped with polygraph preparation.The media has begun to focus on the letter as outlining a lie told by Ms. Ford during recent congressional testimony… But the backstory to Ms. Monica Lee McLean is an even bigger story.First the letter from the boyfriend:McLean also came to the defense of Ford in a letter from former classmates at Holton-Arms private high school, where the two were classmates. Some research into Ms. Ford’s life-long friend from school, Ms. Monica Lee McLean (DOB 03-15-66), reveals an almost guaranteed likelihood the polygraph assistance had something to do with the career path Ms. McLean would take.Monica Lee McLean was admitted to the California Bar in 1992, the same year Ms. Ford’s boyfriend stated he began a six-year relationship with her best friend.  The address for the current inactive California Law License is now listed as *”Rehoboth Beach, DE”.  [*Note* remember this, it becomes more relevant later.]In a 2000 Los Angeles FBI declaration Ms. McLean describes herself as a Special Agent of the FBI, Associate Division Counsel, in the Los Angeles Division Legal Unit:After 2003, Ms. Monica L McLean is working with the SDNY as a Public Information Officer for the FBI New York Field Office, side-by-side with SDNY Attorney General Preet Bharara:On Sept 28, Bharara questioned Senator Flake’s committment to standing against Kavanaugh, he also pushed for an FBI investigation:If Flake flakes once can he not flake again?

I — it sounds right. I was in Rehoboth, Delaware, at the time. I could look into my calendar and try to figure that out. It seemed…MITCHELL: Was it written on or about that date?FORD: Yes, yes. I traveled, I think, the 26th of July to Rehoboth, Delaware. So that makes sense, because I wrote it from there.MITCHELL: Is the letter accurate? FORD: I’ll take a minute to read it.So we have Dr. Blasey-Ford in Rehoboth Beach, DE, on 26th July 2018. We’ve got her life-long BFF, Monica L McLean, who worked as attorney and POI in the DOJ/FBI in Rehoboth Beach, DE…. Apparently at the same time she wrote the letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein.It would appear that Ms. Blasey-Ford was with Ms. Monica L McLean, the retired FBI agent and former New York field office spokesperson, at the time she wrote the letter to Senator Feinstein.That would certainly begin to explain quite a bit about who exactly was handling Ms. Ford; and how there would be an intentional effort, from a subject matter expert, on how to best position the attack against Brett Kavanaugh.Who better to help scrub the internet history, and know what processes and people to enlist in such preparatory work, than a retired lawyer who worked deep inside the FBI?Not only did Ms. McLean possesses a particular set of skills to assist Ms. Ford, but Ms. McLean would also have a network of DOJ and FBI resources to assist in the endeavor.  A former friendly FBI agent to do the polygraph; a network of politically motivated allies?Does the appearance of FBI insider and Deputy FBI Director to Andrew McCabe, Michael Bromwich, begin to make more sense?Do the loud and overwhelming requests by political allies for FBI intervention, take on a different meaning or make more sense, now?Standing back and taking a look at the bigger, BIG PICTURE….. could it be that Mrs. McLean and her team of ideological compatriots within the DOJ and FBI, who have massive axes to grind against the current Trump administration, are behind this entire endeavor?David Laufman was the Department of Justice – National Security Division, Deputy Asst. Attorney General in charge of counterintelligence, cyber security, counterespionage and export controls.  He was inside the DOJ-NSD when the FISA application against Carter Page, and by extension the Trump campaign, was constructed, submitted and approved.If there was any doubt the “small group” of connected DOJ and FBI officials were behind the use of Ms. Ford, you can put that doubt away now that Ms. Ford’s handler, Monica McLean, has enlisted David Laufman as her legal defense.They’re not even trying to hide it anymore.Michael Bromwich is representing Ms. Ford, and David Laufman is representing Ms. McLean.   The concentric Lawfare gang is working overtime, likely pro-bono.It is beyond obvious now that Ms. Christine Blasey-Ford was not just some random ancillary high school acquaintance of Brett Kavanaugh; Ms. Ford appears to have been selected by a group of politically connected FBI and DOJ officials for the purpose of targeting Judge Kavanaugh.All of these DOJ and FBI people are part of a tight network.“Beach Friends”?  Rohoboth Beach friends? ",fake

654,04-Oct-18,"When Ainsley Earhardt asked Tucker Carlson, “What happens next though Tucker, going forward? Will we be able to find out any of this information, or will is it something that will just be swept under the rug again?” Carlson responded: The President himself can find out. And he can let the rest of us know by declassifying this information. He has the power to do that. He can unilaterally declassify whatever he wants. And I hope that he will. Because a lot of people like me, who have lived here you know, my whole life and have watched this stuff happen, are very suspicious that this kind of thing happens regularly. And again, that shakes everyone’s faith in the institution of government. It’s terrible. It has a chilling effect in the most basic way. If you think that the government is listening to you, that your political enemies can destroy you, if you step out of line, then you’re no longer living in a free society.”   Congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump-Russia collusion weeks before the 2016 election, and before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump’s campaign.Former FBI general counsel James Baker met during the 2016 season with at least one attorney from Perkins Coie, the Democratic National Committee’s private law firm.That’s the firm used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s campaign to secretly pay research firm Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence operative, to compile a dossier of uncorroborated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election.The dossier, though mostly unverified, was then used by the FBI as the main evidence seeking a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant targeting the Trump campaign in the final days of the campaign.The revelation was confirmed both in contemporaneous evidence and testimony secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the House Judiciary and Government Oversight committees, my source tells me.It means the FBI had good reason to suspect the dossier was connected to the DNC’s main law firm and was the product of a Democratic opposition-research effort to defeat Trump — yet failed to disclose that information to the FISA court in October 2016, when the Bureau applied for a FISA warrant to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.“This is a bombshell that unequivocally shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump’s opposition — the DNC, Hillary, and a Trump-hating British intel officer — to hijack the election, rather than some conspiracy between Putin and Trump,” a knowledgeable source told me.Baker was interviewed by lawmakers behind closed doors on Wednesday. Sources declined to divulge his testimony, other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins Coie law firm and the FBI. -John Soloman, Opinion Contributor for The HillOn September 17, 2018, the White House answered calls by several GOP lawmakers to declassify the documents related to the Russian investigation, and announced that President Trump was ordering the declassification of the FISA application used to spy on Carter Page, as well as the declassification of the text messages without redaction, between James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr.At the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency, the President has directed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to provide for the immediate declassification of the following materials: (1) pages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page; (2) all FBI reports of interviews with Bruce G. Ohr prepared in connection with the Russia investigation; and (3) all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.In addition, President Donald J. Trump has directed the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr.Watch, as MSNBC host Joy Reid and guests mock President Trump for making the ridiculous claim that his campaign was wiretapped. Democrat Eric Swalwell (CA), claims that wiretapping would be something Donald Trump would want to do, as Joy laughs.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]

We won’t be intimidated by these people.”One of the best examples we’ve seen of pushing back during this time of chaos came from a Senator who was confronted in the halls of the Capitol:A leftist protester ambushed a GOP Senator then couldn’t answer questions he tossed back at her.

Police also said that more charges could be filed.

In light of the political climate these days, that was a dangerous move. Just last month, protesters went to the home of the Homeland Security director and protested in front with her daughters looking on.Fox News reports details on how this was first detected:The intentional publication of the information was first caught by a Twitter bot that automatically tracks any changes made to Wikipedia entries from anyone located in the U.S. Congress and publicizes them on the social media site. The bot account later deleted the tweets because the edits contained personal information.

664,30-Sep-18,"The Democratic Party is not helping itself when its members are caught in scandals and find themselves under investigation. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and her entire office are now facing investigation after the way they handled the confidential letter provided to Feinstein from Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford.According to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Feinstein’s office will be investigated in hopes of determining who leaked Ford’s letter to the press, with the Intercept being one of the first publications to publish about it. The letter was to remain confidential per request of Ford, but it clearly became public and ended up in the hands of someone in the press, likely a leftist leaning publication/website.Sen. Cotton also stated that lawyers who were recommended to Ford are also facing investigation by the D.C. bar for what they did to Ford. They allegedly did not tell Ford that the Senate Judiciary Committee offered to travel to California to interview her regarding her accusations against Kavanaugh.During Ford’s testimony last week, she made it seem like she did not know that the committee would fly out to her. She expressed a fear of flying, even though she flies all the time. Many of us watching her testimony thought she was playing silly when she acted like she had no idea that the committee would travel to her. When Ford delayed the questioning that was set for a Monday, people had thought she was stalling to get her story straight. Technically, it was not Ford stalling. It was allegedly her attorneys who are working pro-bono and are apparently quite friendly with Democrats. So basically, the attorneys didn’t tell Ford that she could have answered questions about the situation from home. Her own lawyers made her fly across the country so they could get another few days to gather dirt on Kavanaugh and plan their next move. That’s my thoughts and I believe many will agree.Cotton speaking about Ford said, as per Politico: “They have betrayed her,” Cotton said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “She has been victimized by Democrats … on a search-and-destroy mission for Brett Kavanaugh.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]He also said Democrats would be at fault if women become less likely to report sexual assaults now because they did not keep Ford’s request confidential, as she had asked.“Any impact that this entire episode has had,“ Cotton told John Dickerson, “on women’s willingness to come forward and report sexual assault, which I encourage them all to do immediately after it happens, is caused by the Democrats, is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respecting her requests for confidentiality.“Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, had received a letter from Ford some months ago describing the incident with Kavanaugh but had kept the material confidential, as requested in the letter. At some point, information about Ford was leaked to the press, though the California Democrat denied that she or her office were responsible.The FBI investigation into Ford’s sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh is unlikely to bring any new evidence to light, Cotton said, adding that the Judiciary Committee had already conducted interviews and/or received letters from people that Ford said attended the gathering at which the alleged assault occurred.“We already know what everyone at the party has said,” he said, adding that the investigation will likely make a few senators more comfortable about voting to confirm Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court.”Sen. Cotton makes a good point. The people who were asked questions and who submitted written letters under risk of penalty are unlikely to magically have any other information. What else will people say that they haven’t already said under risk of being in legal trouble for telling lies.The FBI’s job is to investigate. Brett Kavanaugh has faced a reported six background checks and there was nothing of any sort to suggest that he had anything but an extremely clean record.It’s not a mistake that the letter written by Ford, a Democrat, made its way into the hands of a Democratic Senator, and then into the hands of a leftist leaning publication. Make no mistake about that, it was all likely part of the plan.Ford wanted the letter confidential and she was betrayed by a Democrat who leaked it to the press.If that isn’t a calculated and shameful play, then what is?They used her.She’s being used to destroy a man with a perfect history just so Democrats can stall until 2020 and try to prevent Trump from giving a right-winger a seat on the Supreme Court.Democrats don’t want that, but they had a chance for Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire while Obama was president.Ginsburg refused to retire and once said she’d like to work until she’s 95. Her desire to work that long actually hurt the Democrats who could have solidified a Democratic seat on the Supreme Court had she retired under former President Obama. Her personal interests have now harmed her party. Does anyone in that party think about others, or are they all this greedy and selfish? Maybe the Democratic Party should participate in more honest politics instead of using and abusing people to push their party agenda.",fake

This one case below is enough to disqualify her:Julie Swetnick might have the tables turned on her with the latest news regarding a charge of “sexual misconduct”. Swetnick also lied about her education and work experience. She committed fraud by collecting unemployment while working for a company in D.C. There’s more but this is just what she did while employed by Webtrends.After Swetnick issued a statement last week as the third accuser of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, we come to find out that Swetnick has a checkered past from 18 years ago and beyond. The case below is just one of many that Swetnick has had over the years.Oregon Live reportsWebtrends alleged Swetnick claimed to have graduated from Johns Hopkins University but the company said it subsequently learned the school had no record of her attendance. Webtrends said she also “falsely described her work experience” at a prior employer.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The suit also alleges Swetnick “engaged in unwelcome, sexually offensive conduct” while at Webtrends and “made false and retaliatory allegations that other co-workers had engaged in inappropriate conduct toward her.”The suit alleges Swetnick “engaged in unwelcome sexual innuendo and inappropriate conduct” directed at two male employees during a business lunch, with Webtrends customers present. Swetnick claimed two other employees had sexually harassed her, according to the suit.Webtrends’ suit said it determined Swetnick had engaged in misconduct but could not find evidence to support her allegations against her colleagues. Later, the company alleged, Swetnick took medical leave and simultaneously claimed unemployment benefits in the District of Columbia.In the suit, Webtrends alleged Swetnick threatened legal action against the company over her own harassment claims. The lawsuit claimed that act defamed the business and sought at least $150,000 on behalf of an employee that Swetnick had allegedly made false statements about.WHAT A HOT MESS!

That doesn’t sound like a guilty person.In the meantime, the accuser’s team is demanding special terms before she will testify…They are insisting that Judge Kavanaugh testify first and that he will not be in the room when she testifies.Does Ford want Judge Kavanaugh to testify first so that she can tweak her testimony to make it look like Kavanaugh is lying? It’s a political trap that Judge Kavanaugh should not be put in. The accuser should go first because the burden of proof is on her.The accuser’s lawyers are demanding that there be no lawyers present and only committee members may question Christine Blasey Ford.Ford’s attorneys want the testimony to happen next Thursday at the earliest.Why should the Judiciary Committee be held hostage by this woman and her liberal activist lawyers (SEE BELOW)?A great point was made by Joel B. Pollack about the left’s strategy:The only possible reason for Dr. Ford to demand a Thursday hearing (as opposed to Wednesday/Tuesday or the scheduled Monday) is to prevent the Senate from voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh before month's end, leaving him off the bench when the Supreme Court's next session starts.— Joel B.

If Miss Ford really did not want to come forward, never intended to come forward, never planned to come forward, why did she pay for a polygraph in August and why did she hire a lawyer in August if she never intended to do what she’s doing?… And who’s paid for it?DEBRA KATZDebra Katz, the attorney for Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, is vice chair of the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) which has been directly funded by George Soros’ Open Society Foundation.She’s donated about $24K to liberal causes including Moveon.org and had this to say about Trump advisors on Facebook: “These people are all miscreants. The term ‘basket of deplorables’ is far too generous a description for these people who are now Senior Trump advisors.”Debra Katz is a known lawyer who specializes in the representation of whistleblowers. How was it that she was hired months ago to represent Judge Kavanaugh’s accuser? Remember that Senator Feinstein claimed that the anonymous person wanted to stay anonymous. If that’s the case, why did this woman secure a lawyer specializing in whistleblower cases months ago?POGO has a bio on Katz:Debra Katz is a partner with Katz, Marshall & Banks, LLC, a civil rights law firm based in Washington, D.C.  The firm specializes in the representation of whistleblowers.   Ms. Katz has represented nuclear, financial services, defense contractor and pharmaceutical whistleblowers for more than 30 years.  Ms. Katz received her B.A. degree from Union College in Schenectady, New York and her law degree from the University of Wisconsin in Madison, WI.THE PLOT THICKENS…Also, one of Senator Feinstein’s former aides is actively involved in an organization fighting to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh:PAIGE HERWIG HAS A LONG RESUME OF INVOLVEMENT WITH OBAMA.

679,25-Sep-18,"PROJECT VERITAS takes on the IRS in an undercover video exposing the bias against conservatives:This report features two Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials who candidly discuss the IRS’s unfair treatment of conservative non-profit groups. The two officials in the report are Thomas Sheehy, an IRS tax examiner and member of the Austin Democratic Socialists of America in Texas, and Jerry Semasek, an IRS attorney in Washington, DC.The Austin Democratic Socialists of America is a socialist group that works to advance ‘progressive issues’ in Austin, Texas.Sheehy boasts about and appears to justify former disgraced IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who was mired in scandal for losing tens of thousands of emails regarding the Lois Lerner controversy. The Lois Lerner controversy occurred in 2013 and involved revelations showing that the IRS unfairly scrutinized conservative groups.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]SHEEHY: “John Koskinen. He got a lot of flak for giving increased scrutiny to these Tea Party groups. Conservatives got really mad at him, he was so cool though because he deleted all the emails, so they could not hold any evidence against him.”Sheehy continues:SHEEHY: “Yeah, I don’t give a s**t if that is a crime for doing that because… you should give increased scrutiny to those groups because a lot of them are just f***ing fronts for the Koch brothers or whatever.”In a separate meeting, attorney Semasek discloses to Project Veritas multiple times that “mistakes were made,” during the 2013 scandal when conservative non-profits were targeted when applying for tax-exempt status.SEMASEK: “… you know what, for what it’s worth, on the record, I know people in Tax Exempt Government Entities. All that stuff we saw in the news, yeah mistakes were made”Attorney Semasek, who worked for the IRS during the 2013 scandal, continued:SEMASEK: “… The law requires that an organization can’t be political, it can’t be partisan to be tax exempt… Those employees in Cincinnati Ohio started to separate them and put them in a pile. And it turns out that they were like the Tea Party group of people. And I think they did, like Lois Lerner and maybe some of her employees were more liberal leaning or Democrats so I don’t know if they disallowed them, but they required them to produce more documentation to try to prove that they weren’t partisan.”He repeated that mistakes were made:SEMASEK: “… and that was bad. I think, from what people tell me, that really know about, there were mistakes made, but the problem with what happened… And again, there were mistakes made, and I think probably some people that were advised against conservative groups did make some mistakes.”Sheehy, like individuals featured in the previous reports in this series, is also a member of a political activist group. Sheehy implies that he abuses his work benefits, including paid time off and sick days in order to engage in socialist activism for Austin Democratic Socialists of America.SHEEHY: “I will say, I just really like the benefits. I get a lot of paid time off and sick days. So, like, for DSA stuff, I can just honestly… I will just stay late for a period. So, I will just call in for the next day.”SHEEHY: “I mean, as long as like the manager doesn’t find out and you don’t explicitly say “hey I’m calling in sick to do Democratic Socialist of America work” then I mean like yeah. You know, you just gotta, you just gotta like sort of manage, you know, when and where you’re like doing, like, the work you do.”Sheehy reveals there are more socialist activists at the IRS, referring to a friend of his who works on national communications for the Democratic Socialists of America, as well as writing bylaws for the political organization.SHEEHY: “My friend Chris, like he does a lot of like tech stuff. He even runs the f**kin’, I was looking over his shoulder once at the electoral forum and I noticed that he actually is on the national social media working group. So, he helps run the national twitter account. He also runs our local twitter account. He also is one that does all the bylaws and stuff…. he also works for the IRS.”Sheehy remarks about his disdain for the Constitution of the United States.SHEEHY: “Unfortunately, I am not allowed by the bylaws of my union to go against the constitution.”JOURNALIST: “Would you?”SHEEHY: “Yeah.” ",fake
680,25-Sep-18,"A big update just hit the newswires and the Senate Judiciary Committee has stated that Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s vote is scheduled. They finally agreed on a date and set it for this Friday at 9:30 am.This is one day after Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford are scheduled to testify in front of lawmakers on the sexual assault accusations brought forward by Ford. These are accusations that suggest Kavanaugh tried to take her clothes off at a party, but Kavanaugh denies all accusations and Ford’s story from over 30 years ago doesn’t quite add up.It looks like they want to get the job done and stop playing games with Democrats.Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) told reporters “I go into the hearings with very positive feelings about him, and I hope Thursday goes well” as reported by Fox News.Kavanaugh briefly faced another accusation by a Yale classmate named Deborah Ramirez, but that seems to have been squashed as her story doesn’t add up and it doesn’t appear that she is certain who or what she actually saw. Her claim was that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her while he was intoxicated at a college party back in the 1980’s, an allegation that Kavanaugh has also denied.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Fox News has learned that Judiciary Committee staffers interviewed Kavanaugh by phone about the Ramirez allegations on Tuesday. A source familiar with the call told Fox News that Republican staffers led the interview, while Democratic aides listened without asking any questions.Fox News stated that a successful vote this Friday isn’t required to push him to the Senate. “Current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas received no recommendation from the Judiciary Committee in 1991, but was still confirmed by the Senate. Conversely, Robert Bork received an unfavorable recognition from the committee in 1987, though his nomination was rejected by the full Senate.”Politico also reported “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) can bring Kavanaugh to the floor whether the nominee gets a favorable or unfavorable recommendation. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is undecided on Kavanaugh’s nomination and is the key swing vote on the panel; Flake has not voted in the Senate this week and has not commented on his current thinking about Kavanaugh.“For Republicans to schedule a Friday vote on Brett Kavanaugh today, two days before Dr. Blasey Ford has had a chance to tell her story, is outrageous,” said Sen Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the committee’s ranking member. “First Republicans demanded Dr. Blasey Ford testify immediately. Now Republicans don’t even need to hear her before they move ahead with a vote.”If you think about the timeline of events, Brett Kavanaugh could be confirmed by now if there was no sideshow brought to town by Democrat resisters.Even if Christine Blasey Ford testified yesterday, as she was originally invited to, that means Kavanaugh could have been voted on today.The Democrats seem to have a stalling tactic underway as they keep trying to dig up old accusations, or possibly make them up as they go along.Kavanaugh should be presumed innocent unless proven guilty.This could turn out to be a massive smear campaign by anti-Trumpers.It was previously reported that Diane Feinstein wasn’t certain if Christine Blasey Ford will show up. Ford has had some demands, but it’s unsure if they’ll be met. She has to remember that she doesn’t run the show and when she’s given the opportunity to have her voice heard, then she should take it and stop making so many demands.NEW: Sen.

I’m confident we’re going to win, confident that he’ll be confirmed in the very near future. I believe he’ll be confirmed, yes.”Since all Republicans on the Senate panel are men, McConnell also said the Senate had hired a woman lawyer to do the questioning of Kavanaugh and his accuser.“We have hired a female assistant to go on staff and to ask these questions in a respectful and professional way.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]So first they’re upset that it’s an all men panel that would question her, and so they get a female lawyer with actual experience in questioning sexual assault victims to question her, and they get upset at that.DIANNE FEINSTEIN SPOKE OUT ABOUT KAVANAUGH’S ACCUSER POSSIBLY BEING A NO-SHOW:I'm struggling to remember the last time a witness to the Senate was given authority over how the Senate would operate.

682,24-Sep-18,"Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh is getting slammed by all ends of the media right now. He’s facing one of the biggest character assassinations that I can ever remember in a what appears to be a massive smear campaign by Democrats looking to undermine the work of President Trump and basically attack anyone he selects for just about anything.This guy can’t catch a break and he’s being dragged into a huge mess that all appears to be a big project by Democrats to take him down. Of course, it seems that way based on the evidence and incidents going on thus far. Everything with Christine Blasey Ford, that other accuser (whose name I left out because there’s nothing credible in her story, even less credible than Ford’s), and the Democratic Party seem to be attempting to push Kavanaugh to the edge in hopes that he quits or they turn a few confirmation votes against him.Now the police department in Maryland’s Montgomery County is getting involved and they’ve issued a statement on what’s going on.Their latest statement regarding the alleged victims and their accusations pertaining to Kavanaugh and his accuser/s is in full, below.Statement from the Montgomery County Police Department Regarding Victim Accusations of Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh: https://t.co/U8dK2jTYz3— Montgomery County Department of Police (@mcpnews) September 24, 2018Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]September 24, 2018Statement from the Montgomery County Police Department Regarding Victim Accusations of Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh:At this time, the Montgomery County Police Department has not received a request by any alleged victim nor a victim’s attorney to initiate a police report or a criminal investigation regarding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.The Department recognizes that victims of sexual assault may not want to involve law enforcement and/or initiate a criminal investigation, and we respect that position. The Department, however, stands prepared to assist anyone who reports being the victim of a sexual assault.Typically, in a sexual assault case, the cooperation of the victim or witnesses is necessary. As with any criminal investigation, a determination must be made as to the jurisdiction where the alleged offense occurred and the specific details of the event to establish a potential criminal charge.Our Department is ready to investigate any claim of sexual assault that is alleged to have occurred within our County.Here’s where that gets murky. If there’s an accusation of sexual assault, then why did Christine Blasey Ford go to Diane Feinstein instead of the police? If there’s a second accuser, then why didn’t that person go to the police? Sounds a bit weird, right?Here is the police department, the one likely to receive the call, who is saying that 1) no one has filed any reports of said alleged crimes, and 2) they’re ready to do the work if needed.This is why we cannot just outright believe someone’s accusations from that many years ago without substantial evidence. Had there been a police report from three decades ago, then there would be something concrete that people could utilize. But there’s nothing. There is just the word of the accuser vs the word of the accused, and right about now the accused is looking very innocent.Based on everything that’s going on with Ford and her accusations and her inability to locate a credible witness who supports her claims, there’s just nothing going on there that’s worth looking at Kavanaugh differently.How can you destroy a man’s character with wild accusations like this?Based on the lack of evidence and what looks to be a massive character take-down plot by the Democrats, I can only imagine this circus gets more bizarre before someone finally shuts the door and proceeds with the confirmation of Kavanaugh.Bill Cosby was found guilty for crimes done many years ago, but how many actual witnesses were there? Quite a few. It’s one thing to have that many people telling the same story about his alleged sexual misconduct and it’s easier to find him guilty.However, Christine Blasey Ford is just one person with a slightly shakey story, no witnesses, and basically no one to vouch for her story that it even happened. Her collaboration with Democrats puts an extra damper on it as well.I don’t know about you, but when someone commits a crime, then I would call the police – not the politicians 30+ years later.Calling the police makes sense.Calling a politician does not.What’s really going on here?",fake

684,23-Sep-18,"In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Leslie Millwee says she was thinking about coming out publicly around 1998, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal began to dominate the national conversation.  But at the time, she says she decided to remain quiet, in part fearing for her children after watching the way other Clinton sex accusers were treated by the Clintons and the news media.Three of Millwee’s friends told Breitbart News that she told them in the late 1990’s that Clinton sexually assaulted her while she was a reporter and that the future president allegedly knocked on her apartment door.Millwee claims the assaults took place in a small, isolated editing room at her now-defunct station, KLMN-TV, which covered the Fort Smith/Fayetteville markets.  At the time Millwee reported under the assumed name Leslie Derrick.As part of her job, Millwee says that she covered the so-called Cuban Refugee Crisis, which took place in 1980 when about 125,000 Cubans fled their homeland in boats and were allowed into the U.S.  By May 1980, about 20,000 refugees were housed at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas’s military base, creating security and law enforcement problems for then Governor Clinton with refugees rioting and escaping the compound.Millwee says she interviewed Clinton about 20 times at various public events and at Fort Chaffee and saw him inside the KLMN station.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]She claims that when she was around him, Clinton singled her out with “inappropriate gestures,” and that he made flirtatious comments like, “Hey pretty girl. How are you today?” This went on, Millwee says, for several months.Millwee claims that as part of his attempts to come on to her, Clinton gave her half of his tie and told her that she should give him more attention and hold onto the tie because one day he would be the U.S. president.She also says that Clinton signed his name to a page on her reporter’s notebook that had her own name on it, writing “Clinton” directly above her name.“And I said, ‘What are you doing? Giving me an autograph now?’ And he said, ‘No, I just wanted to show you how good Clinton looks on top of Leslie.’”Millwee provided Breitbart News with an image of Clinton’s alleged signature on her reporter’s notebook. (see below)For the entire Millwee interview with Breitbart News, go here.Yesterday, Millwee left a message for Senator Schumer, who suggested that anyone who has a claim that they’ve been sexually assaulted should come forward. Millwee recorded her powerful message to the hypocritical Democrat Senator and tweeted it, for everyone to hear.Millwee tweeted:This is the message I left for Senator Schumer. Also calling Feinstein. WILL they have the courage or I integrity to call me back?? This is the message I left for Senator Schumer. Also calling Feinstein.

And that means having an investigation that will then lead to a hearing that will then lead to a vote if appropriate. And instead, they are playing the hardest of hardballs to try to pack the court with, you know, another nominee, regardless of the questions.”Millwee just posted her message to Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA), where she asked that she be “believed” by the senior Democrat Senator:My message to Sen. Feinstein today. I daresay I will hear from Schumer or her…. pic.twitter.com/QwfDkDjsKq— Leslie Millwee (@Astroluvr) September 24, 2018",fake
685,23-Sep-18," Democrat activist Christine Blasey Ford sent a letter to Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein in July accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for US Supreme Court Justice, of groping her at a house party over 36 years ago. At the time of the alleged assault, Kavanaugh would have been 17 years old, and Ford would have been 15 years old. Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has an impeccable record, flatly denies the allegations.In addition to being a Democrat activist, Ford’s story has been shaky from the outset. Unfortunately, for the Dems, Ford’s story, which hinges on the testimony of 4 people she identified as witnesses, just experienced an avalanche…In a September 16 Washington Post article, Ford claimed that in addition to herself and Brett Kavanaugh, there were three additional individuals at the party. Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Ingham Keyser.On September 18, Mark Judge sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, stating that he “has no memory of the alleged incident.” “Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Dr. Ford’s letter. More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.Under 18 U.S.C § 1001, letters to the Judiciary Committee are subject to criminal penalty if false.Wall Street Journal reporter Kimberley Strassel breaks it down:Breaking, and a big deal: Fourth person that Ford named as present at infamous event denies even knowing kavanaugh, much less ever attending a party where he was present.1) Breaking, and a big deal: Fourth person that Ford named as present at infamous event denies even knowing kavanaugh, much less ever attending a party where he was present.— Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 23, 2018Statement from Leland Keyser’s attorney: “Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.”Statement from Leland Keyser's attorney: ""Simply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.""— Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) September 23, 2018So to be clear: All four people named have said this party never happened.

And it suggested that key sticking points remained unresolved.“We are hopeful that we can reach agreement on details,” Katz wrote. “Can we set up a time for later this afternoon to continue our negotiations?”During a conference call on July 10th (around the same time that Christine Blasey Ford’s letter was sent to Democrat Senator Diane Feinstein) Ricki Seidman, a Democrat operative, former Clinton White House official and advisor to Kavanaugh accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, admitted to a strategy Democrats had to destroy the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh.Ricki Seidman, who has a history of working for male politicians who either grope little girls, have been accused of raping women, or even better, working for a prominent Democrat Senator who left a woman he was having an affair with, to drown in his vehicle as he walked away.In 2008, Seidman took a leave of absence from her role at TDS Communications to work on Barack Obama’s campaign, where she served at gropin’ Joe Biden’s communications director.

He did say that there was no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment. A very strategic answer dodging key items he’s being accused of. This was all happening in May of 2017 right after Comey was fired.Rosenstein denies the NYT claim:“The New York Times’s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect,” he said in a statement. “I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.The New York Times reported:Mr. Rosenstein made these suggestions in the spring of 2017 when Mr. Trump’s firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director plunged the White House into turmoil. Over the ensuing days, the president divulged classified intelligence to Russians in the Oval Office, and revelations emerged that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to pledge loyalty and end an investigation into a senior aide.Mr. Rosenstein was just two weeks into his job. He had begun overseeing the Russia investigation and played a key role in the president’s dismissal of Mr. Comey by writing a memo critical of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But Mr. Rosenstein was caught off guard when Mr. Trump cited the memo in the firing, and he began telling people that he feared he had been used.Mr. Rosenstein made the remarks about secretly recording Mr. Trump and about the 25th Amendment in meetings and conversations with other Justice Department and F.B.I. officials. Several people described the episodes, insisting on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The people were briefed either on the events themselves or on memos written by F.B.I. officials, including Andrew G. McCabe, then the acting bureau director, that documented Mr. Rosenstein’s actions and comments.The entire report by The New York Times here.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Sara Carter tweeted out support for Trump firing Rosenstein:The evidence in these memos from fired FBI Deputy Dir Andrew McCabe about DAG Rosenstein is enough for @realDonaldTrump to fire him and launch an investigation.

The assistant secretary of state for economic affairs said, “I don’t have personal knowledge of those meetings, but, if that is happening, again, I would find it very inappropriate.”KERRY PLAYS IT OFF LIKE HE WAS JUST SPEAKING OUT: “I didn’t negotiate…I spoke out.”WATCH: ""I didn't negotiate, I spoke out.

Bush, said Wednesday on Fox News’ “Special Report.” “I don’t know if it’s legal or illegal, I don’t care about that side of it. It’s wrong.”…It has been suggested before that Kerry’s meetings with high-profile foreign leaders could violate the Logan Act — which prohibits private citizens from negotiating on behalf of the U.S. government without authorization. No one has ever been successfully prosecuted under the law, however.THE LOGAN ACT:“Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States” is guilty of a federal offense.If this isn’t a clear cut case of a federal offense then they need to just get rid of the Logan Act altogether…It’s a joke.OUR PRIOR REPORT ON KERRY’S MEETINGS WITH IRAN:Who does this guy think he is?

Kerry said he has criticized the current administration in these discussions, chiding it for not pursuing negotiations from Iran, despite the country’s fevered rhetoric about the U.S. president.“Conducting sensitive diplomacy”? This is such a slap in the face to the Trump administration.THE AUDIO OF THE ENTIRE INTERVIEW We’ve previously reported on John Kerry’s meeting with the Iranians:Isn’t it interesting that John Kerry was just seen meeting with Iranian diplomats in Paris, France on Saturday (SEE BELOW).  This was after the Iranian regime threatened to release the names of Western officials who took bribes to make the Iran deal happen.Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman threatened:H.J.Ansari Zarif’s senior advisor: “If Europeans stop trading with Iran and don’t put pressure on US then we will reveal which western politicians and how much money they had received during nuclear negotiations to make #IranDeal happen.”That would be interesting.#JCPOA— Raman Ghavami (@Raman_Ghavami) May 8, 2018OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON JOHN KERRY’S CURIOUS VISIT WITH IRANIAN DIPLOMATS IN PARIS, FRANCE:The always arrogant John Kerry is at it again…So John Kerry just left a meeting @ L’Avenue in Paris w/3 Iranians.

Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI. This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee’s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the “dossier.” Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn’t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it — which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn’t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.The Daily Caller is now reporting that Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, is refusing to appear before Congress for a closed-door hearing that was scheduled to take place this Friday, sources tell The Daily Caller News Foundation.Ohr, who worked for Fusion GPS, the firm behind the Steele dossier, was scheduled to appear for interviews during a joint session with the House Judiciary and House Oversight & Government Reform committees. But two congressional sources said that she is not cooperating with the requests and will have to be subpoenaed to compel her appearance.The sources said that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte is considering a subpoena for Ohr. A spokesman for the Virginia Republican did not respond to a request for comment.The sources also said that former FBI general counsel James Baker is not cooperating with the committees’ request for an interview.Ohr was slated to appear before the committees to discuss her work for Fusion GPS. Ohr, an expert on Russian affairs, worked for Fusion GPS from December 2015 until just after the election.Bruce Ohr, the former assistant deputy attorney general, was in contact with dossier author Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson before and after the election.The Ohrs both met Steele, a former British spy, in Washington, D.C. on July 30, 2016, a day before the FBI formally opened its counterintelligence investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government.Congressional sources have told TheDCNF that Bruce Ohr briefed then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe about his interaction with Steele within days of the meeting.Ohr’s contacts with Steele increased after the FBI cut ties with the dossier author just before the election because of unauthorized contacts with the press. Ohr provided at least a dozen briefings to the FBI about his interactions with Steele from November 2016 to May 2017. – Daily Caller",fake

Senator Grassley has asked why Feinstein didn’t bring up the accusation during the Senate hearings or during the private meeting Judge Kavanaugh had with Feinstein. Great point!Grassley has been around the block many times and this time he smells a rat. Is this a case of Democrats trying to prolong the confirmation process by throwing this Hail Mary pass? Grassley suggested in the letter below he believes that’s the case.The lawyer for Ford says she will not testify until the FBI has done an investigation on the decades-old allegation that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. The problem is that the FBI has already refused to investigate. It is up to the Judiciary Committee to do this and NOT the FBI:Senator Grassley isn’t playing the Democrat’s game. He sent a letter to Senator Feinstein demanding a copy of the unredacted letter from Christine Blasey Ford that Feinstein got in July. But that’s not the only thing he demanded.

To safeguard my own privacy and anonymity, I respectfully request that the Committee accept this statement in response to inquiry the Committee may have.”Judge Kavanaugh has denied being at the party as has another classmate, Mark Judge, who also sent a letter to the Judiciary.

That’s not the case at all.The New York Times issued a retraction later saying that Mark Judge does not remember the episode. Judge has also called it “absolutely nuts” in an interview with The Weekly Standard:Mark Judge, who attended Maryland’s Georgetown Preparatory School with Kavanaugh in the 1980s, told The Weekly Standard on Friday that the assault allegations were “just absolutely nuts.”“I never saw Brett act that way,” Judge said.The NYT retraction corrected the major error but how many readers saw the first version and believed it? The retraction read like this… “An earlier version of this article misstated what Mark Judge told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said that he does not remember the episode, not that he does.”Mr. Judge released a statement (see below) to the Senate Judiciary Committee saying, “Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Ford’s letter.

Will Rivera’s “not guilty” plea and his refusal to accept a speedy trial, change his mind?On August 21, 2018, an illegal alien, Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Iowa College student, Mollie Tibbetts.Tibbetts July 18 disappearance set off a massive search involving state and federal authorities.Rivera led investigators early Tuesday to a body believed to be Tibbetts in a cornfield about 12 miles southeast of Brooklyn, Iowa, where Tibbetts was last seen running, Division of Criminal Investigation special agent Rick Rahn said.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“I can’t speak about the motive. I can just tell you that it seemed that he followed her, seemed to be drawn to her on that particular day, for whatever reason he chose to abduct her,” Rahn told reporters at a news conference outside the sheriff’s office in Montezuma, where Rivera was being jailed.The news that the highly publicized and gruesome crime was allegedly committed by a person in the country illegally drew immediate outrage. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, said: “As Iowans, we are heartbroken, and we are angry.”“We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can to bring justice to Mollie’s killer,” she said in a statement.Investigators said they zeroed in on Rivera after obtaining footage from surveillance cameras in Brooklyn. The footage showed a Chevy Malibu connected to Rivera that was driving back and forth as Tibbetts was running in the area, Rahn said.An affidavit attached to the criminal complaint against Rivera alleged that he admitted to investigators he got out of his car and started running alongside Tibbetts.Tibbetts grabbed her phone and said she was going to call the police. The affidavit says Rivera panicked and then said he blacked out. Rivera next remembers seeing her earphones on his lap, and taking her bloody body out of the trunk of his car, it said.“The defendant further described during the interview that he dragged Tibbetts on foot from his vehicle to a secluded location in a cornfield,” the affidavit said.Investigators said they had earlier searched the area for Tibbetts but didn’t find her, noting the body was covered by corn stalks when recovered early Tuesday.Rahn said that Rivera was cooperating with investigators and speaking with the help of a translator. He said an autopsy would be performed on the body Wednesday by the state medical examiner’s office, which would assist investigators in understanding whether Tibbetts had been assaulted or tried to fight him off.-GVWireIt’s bad enough that an innocent 20-year-old college student with her whole life ahead of her, was taken away in such a brutal manner, but after Christhian Rivera an illegal alien confessed to the murder of Mollie Tibbitts, American taxpayers are now on the hook to pay for his defense, including a taxpayer-funded translator.Meanwhile, Americans are begging lawmakers to join President Trump in his efforts to prevent future events like this one and the Kate Steinle murder by an illegal alien living in a sanctuary city by funding the wall!During their investigation, law enforcement discovered that Rivera lied to his employer about who he was, using fake documents that didn’t belong to him to obtain a job on the dairy farm where he worked for the last 4 years.Today, through a taxpayer-funded translator and a taxpayer-funded legal defense team, Christhian Rivera stunned everyone when he pleaded “not guilty” to first-degree murder and waived his right to a speedy trial.",fake

She didn’t quite ask why he beat his wife… but she came close.Right out of the gate, the senator asked him, “Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual favors or committed verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature?”The #MeToo movement is so out of control with women coming out of the woodwork to lay claim to decades old accusations of groping with no evidence at all. It’s not that we don’t want to give these women the benefit of the doubt.  It’s just that it’s being used by the left as a political tool to destroy powerful men whom we should consider innocent until proven guilty.Mazie Hirono spoke out on the Kavanaugh accuser claiming the woman must be heard.

A source briefed on the matter said that through July she had raised nearly $91 million for the party committee, which is spending big in hotly contested races including where Democratic candidates are running away from Pelosi.Despite facing more opposition from Democrats than any other time in her career, Pelosi’s fundraising strength remains her biggest asset — a clear sign why she continues to maintain a hold atop her caucus. If Democrats retake the House in November, Pelosi is certain to use that appeal to try to convince even her skeptics to give her another opportunity to take the speaker’s gavel.",fake

Christine Blasey Ford, is vice chair of the Project on Government Oversight which has been directly funded by George Soros’ Open Society Foundation. Is this another tactic to drag this process out as long as possible? Grassley calls their bluff by asking “what’s the point” in having the hearing if she doesn’t show up. Why has she not responded?

Will the hearing on Monday be televised?CG: Yeah.HH: And will there only be two witnesses on Monday?CG: Yes.HH: Who’s going to go first?CG: Oh, we haven’t made up our mind on that, yet, but I assume that Dr. Ford would.HH: Has Dr. Ford accepted, and she’s agreed to come?HH: Has Dr. Ford accepted, and she’s agreed to come?CG: No. We have reached out to her in the last 36 hours three of four times by email, and we’ve not heard from them, so it kind of raises the question do they want to, do they want to come to the public hearing or not? And the reason we’re having the public hearing is obviously, well, number one is accusations like this deserve consideration and looking into, and that’s what the purpose of the hearing is. And we wouldn’t be having this hearing if it wasn’t for the fact that Dr. Ford told the Washington Post and other people publicly that she wanted to testify. And we also have Judge Kavanaugh. Even before we requested him to testify, he said he was willing to testify. As of Sunday night, I had that message. So we still haven’t heard from Dr. Ford. So do they want to have the hearing or not? We’re delaying the vote, strictly, to get all the facts out on the table.HH: If Dr. Ford declines to attend, will Judge Kavanaugh appear anyway?CG: First of all, we’ve got to look at why we’re having the hearing. We’re having the hearing because the accusations, accusations that legitimately ought to be looked into about a candidate for the Supreme Court. And it was raised questions what would be the purpose of the hearing if Dr. Ford doesn’t want to respond?GET ON WITH IT!

Dianne Feinstein, routinely hold such “bipartisan staff calls” when updates are made to a nominee’s background file.In this case, Feinstein has refused any follow-up calls with the accused and the accuser.GRASSLEY LET HER HAVE IT:

As the confirmation process for Kavanaugh was coming to a conclusion, here comes a lady saying that he groped her when he was a teenager. Her story doesn’t quite add up and the timing of it is very suspect. It’s almost like a page right out of the Democratic playbook, if such a playbook existed.Granted, there is no proof and there was apparently another male named by the accuser who seems to deny this happened as well.The woman, a big-time Democrat supporter with some alleged wicked ties into the Democratic Party, is basically accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault from like three decades ago, acting like it was attempted rape, and she just came out and said she is willing to testify against him while under oath.Guess what!Kavanaugh said ME TOO! He said he will testify under oath right back at her. BOOM!BREAKING: Lawyer for Kavanaugh accuser tells @TODAYshow Christine Ford is willing to testify publicly before the Senate Judiciary Cmte. Says Ford believes alleged attack was “attempted rape.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]— Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) September 17, 2018Kavanaugh denies anything happened like what she is saying. She also named another man, Mark Judge, who was possibly there when this allegedly happened. He denies it as well.As per the Daily Wire, “I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time,” Kavanaugh said when the allegation first came to light last week.Judge, who Ford says was there in the room, also denies the allegation, telling the Weekly Standard, “I can recall a lot of rough-housing with guys. It was an all-boys school, we would rough-house with each other. I don’t remember any of that stuff going on with girls.”If there was anything between the two people, then I believe it may have been a mutual teenage hookup. You know how teens are now and how they were back in the day. Teenagers are all over each other. Whether we want to admit it or not, we were all 17 at one point and we were probably kissing and telling like it was an extra-curricular activity.We might be shy to admit it now, but when we were 17, we were happy to be kissed by someone we found attractive as we blossomed into adults figuring out life the best way we knew how.If I have to be honest, then I believe this woman is a complete fraud who is totally making up this story. Of course, that’s just my opinion.However, wasn’t her “story” in the hands of the Democrats many weeks ago? Why are they just now pulling the trigger on it?What happens to her if it turns she’s not being honest? Will she face jail for false accusations?The timing of this was highly criticized by Senator Lindsey Graham.I believe if there was a time for an investigation on something like this, then it should have been 30+ years ago when it actually happened.I have a very hard time believing someone who conveniently comes out with a “Me Too” story about a judge who is just about to get nominated to the Supreme Court.Where was this story for the last 30 years and why is it just now breaking right before Kavanaugh joins the SCOTUS?Smells fishy, right?",fake

Anna Eshoo, a Democrat who represents the area. Different sources provided different accounts of the contents of the letter, and some of the sources said they themselves had heard different versions, but the one consistent theme was that it describes an incident involving Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school.  Kept hidden, the letter is beginning to take on a life of its own.The woman is being represented by a “#MeToo” lawyer…so this must be something that happened in high school. Really? Does anyone out there think this man shouldn’t be confirmed because of a high school incident?

710,15-Sep-18,"We’ve previously reported on meatpackers and other industries importing Somali Muslims for the cheap labor only to have problems with the prayer breaks that they must take during the workday. This is a bit of Karma for these globalist meatpacking companies who want cheap labor but now are being forced to pay the workers they fired.One of the problems with the prayer issue is that it causes disruptions in production and can be a safety issue. The trend in accommodations for Muslim practices is rising since the refugee resettlement agencies have actively settled thousands of Somali Muslims across America for companies like Cargill who want the cheap labor (see below).From the Greeley Tribune:DENVER — A big U.S. meatpacker has agreed to pay $1.5 million to 138 Somali-American Muslim workers who were fired from their jobs at a Colorado plant after they were refused prayer breaks, a federal anti-discrimination agency said Friday.Cargill Meat Solutions, a division of Minnesota-based agribusiness company Cargill Corp., also agreed to train managers and hourly workers in accommodating Muslim employees’ prayer breaks at its Fort Morgan beef processing plant, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Wichita, Kansas-based Cargill denies wrongdoing but agreed to settle to avoid further litigation, the federal agency said. The dispute dates back to the firings of the workers in late 2016 after management rescinded policies allowing Muslim employees to take short breaks for prayer:The Denver Post reported on the three day walkout by the Muslim employees:Cargill provides a “reflection room” at the plant where observant Muslim workers are allowed to pray, something that has been available since 2009. Hussein said depending on the season, the workers pray at different times of the day, typically taking five to 10 minutes away from their work. The time was carved out of a 15-minute break period or from the workers’ unpaid 30-minute lunch breaks.Many of the workers banded together and decided to walk off the job in an attempt to sway plant managers to reinstate the prayer policy. “They feel missing their prayer is worse than losing their job,” Hussein said. “It’s like losing a blessing from God.” On Dec. 23, Cargill fired the holdouts who had not returned to work, citing a company policy that employees who do not show up for work or call in for three consecutive days will be let go.In 2017, the agency found that the workers had been harassed and discriminated against for protesting the unannounced policy change that denied them opportunities for obligatory prayer. Hundreds of Somali-Americans work at the plant in Fort Morgan, about 50 miles southeast of Greeley.The Denver Post reported on the influx of Somali Muslims to Fort Morgan, Colorado in 2016:For the last decade, Somali refugees have flocked to this conservative farm town on Colorado’s Eastern Plains. They’ve started a small halal mini-market and a restaurant, sent their children to schools and worked at a meat processing plant.As much as Fort Morgan’s small-town feel reminds many of their rural villages back home, some say they will feel like outsiders until they get what has so far eluded them: a permanent mosque. They are renting two small rooms for a makeshift version, for now.They say they’ve tried to buy property to build a mosque but believe no one wants to sell to them.“If we can own a mosque here, we will be more a part of the community,” said Abdinasser Ahmed, a local Somali leader and public school teacher who fled war-torn Mogadishu in 2003, arrived in Fort Morgan in 2009 to work at the plant and is now a U.S. citizen.The Fort Morgan Times:",fake

Michelle Obama won’t just be peddling her book, however, she’ll also be pushing her special brand of racism, sexism, and hate for anyone who doesn’t agree with her politics of division. She’ll likely work the crowd into a Trump-hating frenzy, hoping to inspire them to make the trip to the polls in the November 2018, mid-term elections to keep the Democrat Plantation Party alive. But will her former supporters, many of whom were previously unemployed, and dependent on the government for their livelihood, who now are employed, and back on their feet, in arguably one of the best economies of our lifetime, buy into her anti-Trump rhetoric?

So now that the hurricane has been downgraded to a category 1 storm, should President Trump take the credit for the downgrade?Wednesday on the radio, LevinTV host Mark Levin poured out his contempt for the media, which is already blaming President Donald Trump for the coming disaster of Hurricane Florence.“We’re seeing our fellow Americans having to flee about one quarter of the United States geographically — millions — because their lives, their property, their livelihoods are threatened by Mother Nature,” Levin said. “And MSNBC and CNN and the Democrats are already blaming Trump.”“It is impossible for the federal government to be everywhere with the kind of personnel and resources that are necessary to address these natural disasters,” Levin continued, showing how deranged these attacks on Trump are.“And then you have these political ambulance chasers and these media ambulance chasers who are already positioning themselves to attack the president.” –Conservative ReviewTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Listen:Although Hurricane Florence, which threatened to be a catergory 4 or 5 storm, has been downgraded to a category 1 storm, Fox News claims that State officials are bracing for the worst.A tattered American flag seen flying on a live surf camera at Frying Pan Tower in North Carolina is evidence of the strong wind gusts pounding the coast.“Hurricane-force winds” had begun hitting the state’s coast, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in an 11 p.m. EDT update.Even though Florence’s winds weakened as it drew closer to land, dropping from a peak of 140 mph earlier in the week, North Carolina Gov.

I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.”Soon after the grandstanding moment, Booker’s team released the documents.The fury over the documents led to a letdown for Democrats. The documents only demonstrated that in 2002, soon after the 9/11 attacks, Kavanaugh was against the racial profiling of people while working for the Bush White House.

So much for the SCOTUS being apolitical…Check out her comments on equality for women. It’s like she’s time traveled back to the 50’s. What is the deal with these women that think we’re still in the dark ages!Speaking to BBC Newsnight in a rare interview, Justice Ginsburg reiterated the importance of the free press.“I read the Washington Post and the New York Times every day, and I think that the reporters are trying to tell the public the way things are,” she said.Justice Ginsburg was nominated by Bill Clinton and is regarded as a liberal.Justice Ginsburg was careful to avoid commenting directly on Donald Trump’s presidency.Before the election, in July 2016, Justice Ginsburg criticised Donald Trump – calling him “a faker”. She later said she regretted making the comments.Watch:“Think of what the press has done in the United States,” she said citing the Watergate scandal. “That story might never have come out if we didn’t have the free press that we do.”Asked about the rise of the so-called “post truth world”, Justice Ginsburg said: “I am optimistic in the long run. A great man once said that the true symbol of the United States is not the bald eagle. It is the pendulum.“And when the pendulum swings too far in one direction it will go back.“Some terrible things have happened in the United States but one can only hope that we learn from those bad things.”Justice Ginsburg said she was encouraged by the Women’s March, which saw millions in the US and around the world take part in anti-Trump protests.“I’ve never seen such a demonstration – both the numbers and the rapport of the people in that crowd. There was no violence, it was orderly. So yes, we are not experiencing the best times but there is there is reason to hope that that we will see a better day.”Justice Ginsburg has been on the Supreme Court since 1993 and – at 83 years-old – is the oldest serving member.Asked how much longer she would stay in post, she said: “At my age you have to take it year by year. I know I’m OK. What will be next year?”She added: “I’m hopeful however, because my most senior colleague the one who most recently retired, Justice John Paul Stevens, stepped down at age 90. So I have a way to go.” – BBCNew York Times 2005: “Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court embraced the practice of consulting foreign legal decisions…rejecting the argument from conservatives that United States law should not take international thinking into account.”“I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life” – Supreme Court Justice SotomayorAs the main stream media does a hit job on Donald Trump for expressing his view that the presiding judge in the Trump University case is biased against him because of Trump’s views on immigration, we have a RACIST Latina Supreme Court Justice who’s openly declaring that the ethnicity and sex of a judge makes a difference in their judging! So which is it?  The left wants to have it both ways but they’re being outed as total hypocrites! Unreal!  Judge Sotomayor questioned whether achieving impartiality “is possible in all, or even, in most, cases.” She added, “And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society.”AND THEY’RE CALLING TRUMP A RACIST?WASHINGTON — In 2001, Sonia Sotomayor, an appeals court judge, gave a speech declaring that the ethnicity and sex of a judge “may and will make a difference in our judging.”In her speech, Judge Sotomayor questioned the famous notion — often invoked by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her retired Supreme Court colleague, Sandra Day O’Connor — that a wise old man and a wise old woman would reach the same conclusion when deciding cases.“I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn’t lived that life,” said Judge Sotomayor, who is now considered to be near the top of President Obama’s list of potential Supreme Court nominees.Her remarks, at the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Law and Cultural Diversity Lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, were not the only instance in which she has publicly described her view of judging in terms that could provoke sharp questioning in a confirmation hearing.This month, for example, a video surfaced of Judge Sotomayor asserting in 2005 that a “court of appeals is where policy is made.” She then immediately adds: “And I know — I know this is on tape, and I should never say that because we don’t make law. I know. O.K. I know. I’m not promoting it. I’m not advocating it. I’m — you know.”The video was of a panel discussion for law students interested in becoming clerks, and she was explaining the different experiences gained when working at district courts and appeals courts. Her remarks caught the eye of conservative bloggers who accused her of being a “judicial activist,” although Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University law school, argued that critics were reading far too much into those remarks.Republicans have signaled that they intend to put the eventual nominee under a microscope, and they say they were put on guard by Mr. Obama’s statement that judges should have “empathy,” a word they suggest could be code for injecting liberal ideology into the law.Judge Sotomayor has given several speeches about the importance of diversity. But her 2001 remarks at Berkeley, which were published by the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal, went further, asserting that judges’ identities will affect legal outcomes.“Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences,” she said, for jurists who are women and nonwhite, “our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging.”Her remarks came in the context of reflecting her own life experiences as a Hispanic female judge and on how the increasing diversity on the federal bench “will have an effect on the development of the law and on judging.”In making her argument, Judge Sotomayor sounded many cautionary notes. She said there was no uniform perspective that all women or members of a minority group have, and emphasized that she was not talking about any individual case.She also noted that the Supreme Court was uniformly white and male when it delivered historic rulings against racial and sexual discrimination. And she said she tried to question her own “opinions, sympathies and prejudices,” and aspired to impartiality.Still, Judge Sotomayor questioned whether achieving impartiality “is possible in all, or even, in most, cases.” She added, “And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society.”Read more: NYT    ",fake

A number appear to be out-of-state abortion activists who are calling at the promptings of Planned Parenthood, NARAL and other pro-abortion groups.Here’s more from the report:“If you care at all about women’s choice, vote ‘no’ on Kavanaugh. Don’t be a dumb bitch,” one caller said. “F**k you, also. ”Another caller said Collins was “a feckless, feckless, feckless woman standing there letting Trump and his appointees steal the right to choose what women do with their bodies. And you stood by, ‘Oh, I don’t know. I’m so naive.’ F**k you. F**k you,” the caller said.A letter sent to her office in Portland, Maine, read: “If you vote fo Kavanaugh, EVERY waitress who serves you is going to spit in your food, and that’s if you’re lucky, you f**king c**t! Think of that every meal.”Another caller told one of Collins’s 25-year-old female staffers that he hoped she would be raped and impregnated, according to another voicemail that was provided to The New York Times by Collins’s spokeswoman Annie Clark.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS:Senator Susan Collins would really be called a Democrat in most other states. She’s a middle-of-the-road voter in the Senate who doesn’t tow the party line 100% of the time. She certainly won’t be swayed by a ‘bribe’ from Maine progressives who are trying to persuade her to vote against Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court:Maine Senator Susan Collins claims she is not swayed by  what she calls a ‘bribe’ from crowdfunding aimed at encouraging her to oppose Judge Kavanaugh for SCOTUS:“I consider this quid pro quo fundraising to be the equivalent of an attempt to bribe me to vote against Judge Kavanaugh.”The Democrats have pulled out all the stops to postpone or stop the Kavanaugh vote. Two groups from Maine have pledged to donate up to $1.3 million to Collins’s next opponent if the Maine senator votes to confirm Kavanaugh.Via The Hill:The Democrats also sent her 3,000 coat hangers!She probably wasn’t expecting this to arrive in her mailbox, but centrist Senator Susan Collins, a Republican representing Maine, surely got the delivery of a lifetime when she was mailed about 3,000 coat hangers from activists who are trying to sway her vote against Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.The coat hangers are suggested to represent illegal back-alley abortions and likely come from feminist activists or women who believe Kavanaugh will magically whisp away women’s rights the moment he takes office. That’s not likely to happen, of course, but there’s often very little chance of explaining the truth to people who are far-left thinkers bent on destroying every nominee Trump picks and every decision he makes.Some people might wonder that if someone else was president and chose Kavanaugh to be nominated for the Supreme Court, would the hardcore leftists still be acting like this? Or would they be more accepting? Has Trump brought out the worst of the left with every move he makes? That’s certainly worth consideration.Other activists, or those simply disinterested in Kavanaugh, are using television ads to gain the centrist senator’s support and offering to help fund her opponent’s campaign if she votes for Kavanaugh to get in. That puts Sen. Collins in a rough position because she’s forced to do what’s right but might give her future opponent some leverage if the people buying the television ads actually do fund her opponent. On the contrary, her vote for Kavanaugh could gain the support of President Trump and that might be all she needs to victorious in her own election in 2020.It’s obvious that Collins is a swing vote and people are begging for her attention, even threatening to pledge money against her in the future. Sending her 3,000 hangars was probably a bad move because if she finds that repulsive and childish, then she will likely make up her mind and go with Kavanaugh even faster.However, she has also said “she wouldn’t vote to confirm a nominee who was hostile to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case that legalized abortions.She said Kavanaugh during a meeting told her he considered the case to be established precedent. However, critics are concerned about a recently revealed email from 2003, from when Kavanaugh worked in the Bush administration, in which Kavanaugh said the Supreme Court “can always overrule its precedent.”A Collins spokeswoman told the AP the email didn’t change the senator’s mind about what Kavanaugh had told her.“I always wait until after the hearings are complete before making a decision, and I’ll do so in this case as well,” Collins, who has never voted against a Supreme Court nominee, told The Associated Press in an interview.”With that said, she becomes an even bigger swing vote. She has strong convictions about Roe V. Wade, but she has also not ever voted against a SCOTUS nominee.Perhaps people vying for her attention should do it in a more classy way instead of threatening her with hangers and television commercials.Hopefully, she already has her mind made up and helps confirm Kavanaugh.",fake

Isn’t it ironic that the man who wants to shower everyone with freebies from the government won’t even show his son with an endorsement…? There’s nothing quite like a stingy socialist!Levi Sanders, a 48-year-old legal services analyst, jumped into the 1st District congressional race in February 2017, a swing district won by President Trump left vacant by Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter’s retirement. Seven other Democrats were also vying for the nomination. Sanders lives in the neighboring 2nd District, but members of Congress aren’t required to live in the districts they’re seeking to represent, just in the state.Echoing a phrase his father used frequently on the campaign trail, Levi Sanders also said that “it is time to demand that we have a system which represents the 99 percent and not the 1 percent who have never had it so good.”Apparently, socialism isn’t as big of a hit in New Hampshire as it is in Bernie’s communist state of Vermont.According to the Huffington Post, Bernie Sanders’ Son, Levi, has lost the New Hampshire Congressional PrimaryTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Levi Sanders, the son of Sen.

He was considered a long-shot candidate in the race, having raised less than $40,000, according to Federal Election Commission filings. His residence in the state’s 2nd Congressional District also hindered his campaign.Levi’s been spending a lot of time on the campaign trail. Maybe now, it’s a good tie to relax at one of his socialist father’s 3 homes, like the one on Lake Geneva. Or maybe, he could spend some time with his mother, who is currently under investigation by the FBI for bank fraud.So many options…  ",fake

Please watch the insanity below and you’ll see where we’re heading if we don’t win in November. Numerous comments on YouTube are in support of this! This is from Great Britain but is the very same premise used in the US by socialist candidates: SOCIALIST PARTY USA
All work will be voluntary. Money will be obsolete. When a society collectively owns the means of production and distribution, then it will also own all the goods and services being produced. No one has to pay for what they already collectively own.There are numerous candidates running this November who believe in socialism. #Vote #WalkAwayTRANSCRIPT:The present economic system is based upon the class ownership of the means of living. It is not geared to meeting our needs but to making profits for those who own the world’s resources. The gap between the rich and everyone else is now greater than ever before. Oxfam reports that eight people now own as much wealth as half the world’s population.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]National and local politicians are just running capitalism in the only way it can be run – as a system where priority has to be given to profit-making over meeting human needs. It’s the system that’s to blame, not those elected to run it. That’s why changing the politicians in charge makes no difference. Changing governments changes nothing. It will be like this as long as the profit system lasts. And so there is no point in voting for parties that accept this system.Across the world capitalism holds centre stage. Its cruelties and inequalities are too numerous to count, yet almost everybody imagines it is here for good. In the wings, however, a new society is waiting. It is not supposed to exist, but it is there just the same, the next stage of history, the one that comes after capitalism. It stands impatiently in the shadows as the world grinds on regardless. This society is different in one basic respect from all that has gone before – it is based not on material scarcity but on abundance.The new society is one without leaders just as it is one without owners and wage –slaves. It is a wholly democratic society, one which can only be achieved when you – and enough like-minded people – join together to bring it about peacefully and democratically.The Socialist Party is a democratic organisation of equals. There is no leader and there are no followers.Our aim is to build a movement with the single objective of creating a world socialist society based upon the common ownership and democratic control of all the earth’s resources. This social system will be one in which goods and services are produced voluntarily and made freely available to us all. Wealth will be created directly to meet our needs and not for the profit of a few.This is not a utopia but a practical solution to the problems we all face.www.worldsocialism.org/spgb",fake

As more information comes to light about Brennan when he was CIA Director, it’s puzzling that he was even given the job. It seems he was more of a political appointee than a part of the intel system.One of the worst things he did to put politics before the Benghazi survivors is hand out non-disclosure letters to the victims at a memorial service:The Weekly Standard reports:Two Benghazi survivors were presented the nondisclosure agreements during a memorial service at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, honoring Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, two of the CIA-affiliated personnel who died during those attacks.Brennan was protecting Obama and Clinton from any damage before the election.

He has said he and his team lost their security clearances for speaking out.Security operators including Paronto previously had to sign non-disclosure agreements — Paronto told Fox News he signed three pertaining to Benghazi within a six-month period — though Brennan told lawmakers in 2014 this was not a specific effort to prevent them from speaking to Congress.Paronto maintains, however, that he didn’t share classified information in telling the Benghazi story and continues to object to their clearances being revoked.PARONTO CONTINUED HIS TWITTER BATTLE AGAINST BRENNAN:https://twitter.com/KrisParonto/status/1030278280719544320CLUELESS SWAMP CREATURES:Everyone’s so concerned about Brennan’s loss of his security clearance but have they looked at the dirty deeds from this guy?

This is fantastic and really puts a damper on the effort by Democrats to stop this nominee from being confirmed.MAGA! TRUMP2020!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON KAVANAUGH’S NOMINATION BY PRESIDENT TRUMP:President Trump has just nominated 53-year-old Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court.President Trump praised the George W. Bush appointed federal appeals court judge.“There is no one in America more qualified for this position, and no one more deserving. This incredibly qualified candidate deserves a swift confirmation.”President Donald Trump has picked Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge with extensive legal credentials and a lengthy political record, to succeed Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court.“Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials,” Trump said, shortly after announcing his pick. “Throughout legal circles, he is considered a true judge’s judge.”Kavanaugh, 53, is an ideological conservative who is expected to push the court to the right on a number of issues including business regulation and national security. The favorite of White House Counsel Donald McGahn, Kavanaugh is also considered a safer pick than some of the more partisan choices who were on the president’s shortlist.A graduate of Yale Law School who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh has the traditional trappings of a presidential nominee to the high court.If confirmed, the appellate judge would become the second young, conservative jurist Trump has put on the top U.S. court during his first term. Kavanaugh’s confirmation would give the president an even bigger role in shaping U.S. policy for decades to come. The potential to morph the federal judiciary led many conservatives to support Trump in 2016, and he has not disappointed so far with the confirmation of conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and numerous federal judges.At times, he has diverged from the Republican party’s ideological line on important cases that have come before him, including on the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care law which Kavanaugh has declined to strike down on a number of occasions in which it has come before him.Anti-abortion groups quietly lobbied against Kavanaugh, pushing instead for another jurist on Trump’s shortlist, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett, ABC News reported in the run-up to Trump’s announcement.Kavanaugh received his current appointment in 2006 after five years in the George W. Bush administration, where he served in a number of roles including staff secretary to the president. He has been criticized for his attachment to Bush, as well as his involvement in a number of high-profile legal cases. – CNBCBrett Kavanaugh, Pres.

737,05-Sep-18,"TMZ is reporting that the reason Nike used Kaepernick in their new controversial ad is because most of their customers are in urban areas. It’s also being reported that most of Nike’s customers are in foreign countries.If these reports are true then that would mean the Americans living everywhere but in urban areas might think twice before supporting a company that clearly doesn’t support them. It’s hard to believe that Nike isn’t supported by the average ‘Deplorable’ American living in the suburbs except for the fact that the only people looking up to Kaepernick are people who have only supported groups like “Black Lives Matter”. Both a sham…TMZ reported the following Wednesday:Nike’s decision to make its bold deal with Colin Kaepernick was partly a shrewd business move, but sources involved in the negotiation tell TMZ Sports a big part was also cultural.Our sources say Nike was fully aware there would be outrage by embracing Kaepernick’s cause but, on balance, the company knew it would attract way more customers than it would lose. Although the target demos are highly protected by Nike — industry sources tell TMZ Nike’s customer base is “significantly urban” and the company felt the decision would be solidly embraced.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]So it’s a “cultural” decision based on industry sources believing the customer base is “significantly urban”. Well, here’s the result of the decision Nike felt would be “solidly embraced”:It sure doesn’t look like this is going so well for Nike.The silent majority is speaking out loud and clear!The best commentary we’re heard on the outrage is with Chris Kyle’s widow Taya Kyle:Taya Kyle knows what real sacrifice is…Her hero husband sacrificed everything for his country. Kyle decided to let Nike and Colin Kaepernick have it after the new Nike ad claims the failed football player “sacrificed everything”.She sent a brutal message to the sports outfitter and the failed football player. It’s gone viral and is fantastic! We salute you,  Taya!Taya Kyle’s Facebook Post:Nike, I love your gear, but you exhaust my spirit on this one. Your new ad with Colin Kapernick, I get the message, but that sacrificing everything thing…. It just doesn’t play out here. Sacrificing what exactly? A career? I’ve done that both times I chose to stay home and be with my kids instead of continuing my business climb… and it wasn’t sacrificing everything. It was sacrificing one career and some money and it was because of what I believe in and more importantly, who I believe in.At best, that is all Colin sacrificed… some money and it’s debatable if he really lost his career over it. Maybe he sacrificed the respect of some people while he gained the respect of others. Or maybe he used one career to springboard himself into a different career when the first was waning. I don’t know. What I do know is, he gained popularity and magazine covers he likely wouldn’t have gotten without getting on his knees or as you say, “believing in something.” I’m also thinking the irony is that while I am not privy to the numbers, it’s likely he gained a lucrative Nike contract. So yeah… that whole “sacrificing everything” is insulting to those who really have sacrificed everything.You want to talk about someone in the NFL sacrificing everything? Pat Tillman. NFL STARTING, not benched, player who left to join the Army and died for it. THAT is sacrificing everything for something you believe in.How about other warriors? Warriors who will not be on magazine covers, who will not get lucrative contracts and millions of followers from their actions and who have truly sacrificed everything. They did it because they believed in something. Take it from me, when I say they sacrificed everything, they also sacrificed the lives of their loved ones who will never be the same. THAT is sacrificing everything for something they believe in.Did you get us talking? Yeah, you did. But, your brand recognition was strong enough. Did you teach the next generation of consumers about true grit? Not that I can see.Taking a stand, or rather a knee, against the flag which has covered the caskets of so many who actually did sacrifice everything for something they believe in, that we all believe in? Well, the irony of your ad..it almost leaves me speechless. Were you trying to be insulting?Maybe you are banking on the fact we won’t take the time to see your lack of judgement in using words that just don’t fit. Maybe you are also banking on us not seeing Nike as kneeling before the flag. Or maybe you want us to see you exactly that way. I don’t know. All I know is, I was actually in the market for some new kicks and at least for now, I’ve never been more grateful for Under Armour.WE SAY BRAVO TO TAYA KYLE!",fake

If there was an ounce of a doubt who the winner should be, then Texans better get on the horse and ride right to the voting booth to make sure their vote for Ted Cruz is in. It doesn’t matter what the polls say, if you’re in Texas then you need to vote no matter what!I call Beto “Mr. Burn The Flag” due to his response in the video below, not because he burned a flag. Do not confuse a sarcastic joke for real life or as an accusation that Beto ever burned a flag. This article in no way suggests that Beto would burn the flag, but he certainly appears to support other people doing it based on the video below. I have to say this because liberals will turn my sarcasm into an “omg he said Beto burned a flag he’s fake news” and everyone knows that’s a fact that liberals overexaggerate things or make things up that are not true. So again, I am not saying that Beto has ever burned a flag nor am I accusing him of it. However, he appears to support it, so I’m calling him whatever I want in regards to the article. Deal with it. All it takes is one look at this video by Ted Cruz showing Beto’s answer about the American flag being desecrated to know that he isn’t the right guy for Texas. I’m not a fan of Beto and if I lived in Texas, then Ted Cruz would have my vote in an instant.

I can only imagine that Texans have had enough of that nonsense during their NFL season with their teams.There is nothing American about taking a knee or desecrating the American flag. That’s our one iconic piece of America that we absolutely respect because of all the people who lost their lives fighting for it and all the people who continue fighting for it.We can hate each other all we want, but we all live in this country together and there’s one thing that we should all collectively respect, and that’s the American flag.We don’t need to agree on everything.We don’t need to like everyone.We can bicker and argue about anything in the world, but when the national anthem comes on, we all stop and pay our respects for a few moments, then we go back to our business.People who disrespect the flag are a special kind of selfish. They’re putting themselves over everything. They’re making their message all about “me, me, me – look at me, I’m a whiny brat who wants attention, everyone look at me taking a knee, I need social media likes wah wah wah” – that’s what people really see when someone posts a video of themselves burning a flag or taking a knee during the national anthem.While they see themselves as an edgy social justice warrior, the rest of us see a disrespectful entitled brat.Beto answered that question like an entitled brat.Ted Cruz is a winner who stands for the Constitution.A vote for Ted Cruz is a vote for America.We can’t let someone win an election who thinks destroying the flag is an American thing to do.It’s a horrible thing to do. Get it right.Disclaimer: Ted did not pay me to write this, but if he wants to send me a few thousand campaign bucks, then he can speak to my manager.Everyone else can please share this to spread the word and support Ted Cruz.",fake

Here’s the description of their page:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Nike, once a great American company, announced that they’re using the anthem-kneeling, former second-rate quarterback Colin Kaepernick for their 30th anniversary of their iconic “Just Do It” ad campaign.We stand with the men and women who actually put their life on the line every day for their families, our families, and our nation.

Just be safe when you do it.The point is to let the suits at Nike know that we’re ready and willing to stand our ground and that they just erased half of their customer base.The “Just Burn It.” campaign video can be viewed below:For anyone who thought burning NIKE gear would put an end to NIKE’s decision to make the failed NFL quarterback, turned unemployed anti-American activist the face of their massive sports apparel corportation, it appears as though other major sports apparel corporations were simultaneously working on a deal to secure a sponsorship by Kaepernick.Breitbart reports – For those looking to boycott Nike for signing original anthem protester Colin Kaepernick to a major ad campaign, you might also want to add Adidas and Puma to the list.According to Yahoo! reporter Charles Robinson, both Adidas and Puma were also talking about engaging the controversial former quarterback in a lucrative ad campaign.For the “I’m going with #Adidas or #Puma” crowd. There’s always #NewBalance. https://t.co/qlVMazSGHp— Charles Robinson (@CharlesRobinson) September 4, 2018In his Yahoo Sports article about the reported negotiations by Addidas, Puma and Nike Robinson to get a deal with Kaepernick, Robinson wrote: Last spring, when NFL team owners were privately battling the collusion case brought against the league by former quarterback Colin Kaepernick, a curious debate began in some corners of the multibillion-dollar sports apparel industry.It orbited around two questions: Was Kaepernick a sleeping giant as a marketing centerpiece; and if he was, why wasn’t Nike doing anything with him?In the wake of Kaepernick’s new endorsement deal with Nike, which stands to pay him millions per year plus royalties, at least part of that debate has been resolved. The shoe and clothing giant definitely has big plans for Kaepernick, which one insider told Yahoo Sports includes a line built around him encompassing shoes, shirts, jerseys and other apparel.Whether that gamble pays off remains to be seen. But Nike apparently wasn’t the only shoe company that eyed a larger platform for Kaepernick. Industry insiders told Yahoo Sports that Adidas and Puma were among multiple brands that had conversations about potentially building around Kaepernick if Nike failed to renew his deal following a long stretch of endorsement inactivity.“We talked about Colin in March. A lot, actually,” one shoe industry executive said. “We all know the specific kind of deals NFL players are on with each other. His deal was running out and he had a shoe commitment that hadn’t been done for whatever reason. I’m sure it was because of everything that was going on around him. But it looked like Nike was running out the clock on [his deal] because he didn’t have a lot of time left and nothing was really happening with him. So there were some discussions for us about what kind of an endorser he could be.“It’s apparent that, you know, even though he isn’t playing, he’s still connecting with a lot of people. I also think he’s exponentially more popular, and in some cases unpopular, than he ever was in the NFL.”According to reporter Darren Rovell of ESPN, Nike appears to be attempting to backtrack on their full embrace of the anti-American, failed QB, Colin Kaepernick, by saying they have no plans to give Kaepernick his own signature shoe, or extensive clothing line. Charles Robinson, senior NFL reporter for Yahoo News, claims this isn’t exactly accurate, that Kaepernick has indeed, signed a contract with Nike for a signature shoe.I have tremendous professional respect for Darren but we’re going to step on each other here. I’ve been told by multiple sources there is absolutely a contract commitment by @nike for a signature shoe and “Kaepernick 7” line of apparel.

742,03-Sep-18,"The interviewer for Israel’s Channel 2 touched a nerve when she asked Monica Lewinsky if she expects an apology from Bill Clinton.

Lewinsky said she was ostracized by the Jewish community in her area after the news of her affair with Clinton was reported.Lewinsky claimed that this lead to some dark times…The thing that’s so wrong in all of this is that Clinton was recently asked if he ever apologized directly to Lewinsky. He said he felt like he didn’t owe her a personal apology. Wow! Isn’t that sad and so wrong. It’s always all about Bill…he was a mama’s boy who could do no wrong then grew up to marry a wife who was equally enabling of his bad behavior…It’s all about Bill, don’t you know.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]IT’S ALL ABOUT BILL…In June, Clinton told NBC News he didn’t believe he owed Lewinsky a personal apology.‘I do not – I have never talked to her. But I did say publicly on more than one occasion that I was sorry,’ Clinton told NBC.‘I apologized to everybody in the world,’ Clinton said, implying that was enough.The former president also said he, too, was a victim of the entire saga since he left the White House $16million in debt.The fireworks start at the 3:00 point:All of that is total BS! Bill Clinton has the silver tongue of a grifter who gliders through life discarding damaged women while Hillary looks the other way. These two grifters are sickening.However you feel about Monica Lewinsky, she deserves an apology from Bill Clinton. Shame on him for playing the victim!

743,03-Sep-18,"It’s hard to believe but former Secretary of State John Kerry just threw Obama under the bus…in a big way! Why is Kerry just now second guessing Obama’s “red line” in Syria? Is he planning on running in 2020? The video from “Face The Nation” is below if you’re brave enough to hear Kerry drone on.It seems like Kerry is trying to make amends for the thousands upon thousands of Syrians murdered by their own government while Obama stood by and did nothing. President Barack Obama famously drew a proverbial red line in the sand with Syria’s Assad and then didn’t follow through with action against the brutal leader’s gas attacks on civilians. What was 100,000 casualties is now over 4 times that amount of casualties. Obama sat on his hands…THE  NEW YORK TIMES reported:In seven years, the casualties of Syria’s civil war have grown from the first handful of protesters shot by government forces to hundreds of thousands of dead.But as the war has dragged on, growing more diffuse and complex, many international monitoring groups have essentially stopped counting.Even the United Nations, which released regular reports on the death toll during the first years of the war, gave its last estimate in 2016 — when it relied on 2014 data, in part — and said that it was virtually impossible to verify how many had died.At that time, a United Nations official said 400,000 people had been killed.JOHN EDWARDS:John Kerry also just came out to say he regrets picking John Edwards as his running mate i2004 when he ran for president. Why would he suddenly feel the need to announce that? Strange…Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]JAMES TAYLOR:Kerry has a big enough ego to think he’s still relevant on the world stage. He’s known for his pompous and elitist style…remember when he flew famed singer James Taylor to Paris when they had a terrorist attack? Talk about out of touch!Yes, we can see that just like in Paris, John Kerry thinks he’s needed in order to fix things HE thinks are  wrong. It’s just that he couldn’t be more out of touch with the American people. This is a man who has always put politics over the people so why should we expect anything different…Daily Mail reports:Former Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday during an appearance on Face the Nation that he thinks former president Barack Obama should have enforced his ‘red line’ warning in Syria and thinks the United States paid a price as a result.Kerry said he thought Obama was going to launch a missile strike in Syria in 2013 after the country attacked its own citizens with chemical weapons.A year before the attack, Obama had warned Syrian president Bashar al-Assad that the use of chemical weapons would be a ‘red line’ that would be a ‘game changer’ for US involvement in Syria.‘I thought we were going to go forward. I thought that weekend was the weekend. I expected the phone call to be telling me that he had decided we were striking that night or whatever was going to happen, and it wasn’t,’ Kerry said on Face the Nation.I put several ideas on the table. The president was not persuaded by my argument. I believed that we had several options we could have done at very low risk to be able to make it clear to Assad that when we had a ceasefire and when he said he was going to live by it, he had to live by it. And I thought we should have done that.’Kerry said he thinks the US ‘paid a price’ because Obama did not stand by his warning.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXvI9MRGkCM",fake

Not only is she recruiting children to divide us, she’s lied about her background too:The hardscrabble biography of Democrat Congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been called into question after the revelation that she grew up mostly in wealthy Westchester County.Though Ocasio-Cortez, 28, was born in and currently lives in the Bronx, county land records show her late father Sergio Cortez-Roman bought a quaint three-bedroom in Yorktown Heights, New York in 1991, when she was about two.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]It is an apparent contradiction with the candidate’s official biography, which states in part: ‘The state of Bronx public schools in the late 80s and early 90s sent her parents on a search for a solution. She ended up attending public school 40 minutes north in Yorktown, and much of her life was defined by the 40-minute commute between school and her family in the Bronx.’Ocasio-Cortez also boasted on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show that President Donald Trump, born in Queens, wouldn’t know how to handle ‘a girl from the Bronx’ such as herself.Little-known before her shock Democratic primary defeat of 10-term Congressional incumbent Joe Crowley on Tuesday night, Ocasio-Cortez has featured her own hard-luck biography as a key selling point in her insurgent campaign.With New York’s 14th district, encompassing parts of the Bronx and Queens, leaning heavily Democrat, she is believed to be a shoo-in for the House in the November general election.Ocasio-Cortez was born in 1989 to parents Sergio Ocasio-Roman, who was born in New York City, and mother Blanca Ocasio-Cortez, a native of Puerto Rico.Her father, who tragically died from lung cancer in 2008, was an architect and the CEO of Kirschenbaum & Ocasio-Roman Architects, PC, which focused on remodeling and renovations.Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign biography describes her father as ‘a small business owner’.‘She grew up in a working-class household where her mother cleaned homes and everyone pitched in on the family business,’ the bio continues.Initially, the young family lived in Parkchester, a planned community of 171 mid-rise brick buildings in the Bronx.When she was about five, Ocasio-Cortez’s family moved to the house in Westchester County, a detail that the bio omits.The timing of the move is confirmed in a New York Times interview with mother Blanca Ocasio-Cortez, but the report does not address the discrepancy.The home, a single-story with a finished basement, most recently sold for $355,000 in 2016. The median annual income in the area is $116,741, compared to the median annual income of $48,315 in Parkchester’s zip code, according to the latest Census data.‘It was clear to her, even then, that the zip code a child was born in determined much of their destiny,’ Ocasio-Cortez’s official bio reads. –Daily Mail",fake

747,01-Sep-18,"The American Bar Association just made it that much more difficult for the Democrats to try and sabotage the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY:The American Bar Association has a panel that gives evaluations of judges based on many different factors. The measures include qualities like integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament.THE KEY TO THE ABA RATING:WQ = Well Qualified; Q = Qualified; NQ = Not Qualified; sm = substantial majority; m = majority; min = minorityTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Although there has been some controversy over possible bias by the organization, ideology is not one of the factors in the panel’s decisions:“The committee’s objective is to provide impartial peer evaluations of the professional qualifications of judicial nominees in order to assist the Senate Judiciary Committee in assessing whether such individuals should be confirmed by the Senate.”Law professors look over a candidate’s body of written work while others interview lawyers and judges who practiced with the candidate.The highest rating from the ABA is a “well qualified” score. Prior SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch also got a “well-qualified” score from the ABA panel.The great news for the current Supreme court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh is that he also got a “well qualified” score from the American Bar Association! This is fantastic and really puts a damper on the effort by Democrats to stop this nominee from being confirmed.MAGA! TRUMP2020!OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON KAVANAUGH’S NOMINATION BY PRESIDENT TRUMP:President Trump has just nominated 53-year-old Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court.President Trump praised the George W. Bush appointed federal appeals court judge.“There is no one in America more qualified for this position, and no one more deserving. This incredibly qualified candidate deserves a swift confirmation.”President Donald Trump has picked Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge with extensive legal credentials and a lengthy political record, to succeed Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court.“Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials,” Trump said, shortly after announcing his pick. “Throughout legal circles, he is considered a true judge’s judge.”Kavanaugh, 53, is an ideological conservative who is expected to push the court to the right on a number of issues including business regulation and national security. The favorite of White House Counsel Donald McGahn, Kavanaugh is also considered a safer pick than some of the more partisan choices who were on the president’s shortlist.A graduate of Yale Law School who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh has the traditional trappings of a presidential nominee to the high court.If confirmed, the appellate judge would become the second young, conservative jurist Trump has put on the top U.S. court during his first term. Kavanaugh’s confirmation would give the president an even bigger role in shaping U.S. policy for decades to come. The potential to morph the federal judiciary led many conservatives to support Trump in 2016, and he has not disappointed so far with the confirmation of conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and numerous federal judges.At times, he has diverged from the Republican party’s ideological line on important cases that have come before him, including on the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care law which Kavanaugh has declined to strike down on a number of occasions in which it has come before him.Anti-abortion groups quietly lobbied against Kavanaugh, pushing instead for another jurist on Trump’s shortlist, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett, ABC News reported in the run-up to Trump’s announcement.Kavanaugh received his current appointment in 2006 after five years in the George W. Bush administration, where he served in a number of roles including staff secretary to the president. He has been criticized for his attachment to Bush, as well as his involvement in a number of high-profile legal cases. – CNBCBrett Kavanaugh, Pres.

752,30-Aug-18,"Sen. Lindsey Graham paid tribute to the late Sen. John McCain on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon, memorializing their storied friendship and McCain’s legacy.“He taught me that honor and imperfection are always in competition,” Graham said. “I do not cry for a perfect man. I cry for a man who had honor and always was willing to admit to his imperfection.”Graham recalled McCain’s 2008 concession speech as one of the most memorable moments of his long career.“John taught us how to lose,” Graham said. “When you go throughout the world, people remember his concession speech as much as anything else. There are so many countries where you can’t afford to lose because they’ll kill you. And John said that night, ‘President Obama is now my president.’ So he healed the nation at a time he was hurt.

Graham also reminded Bash that he and John McCain even asked President Obama what they could do to help. Senator Graham then told something the liberal CNN host could never understand,  he told her he will always put his country first. Graham said he regretted the relationship between Trump and McCain, and that Trump’s criticism of McCain even “pissed me off”.Graham then stunned Bash by telling her that after his speech on the Senate floor where he honored Senator McCain, he received a touching phone call from President Trump, telling him “That was very sad. I just want you to know that you did right by your friend.”Bash appeared to be stunned, acting as though she misheard what Graham said, asking him to confirm, “The President called you?” Graham responded by saying, “Yes, he did, right out of the blue”, Graham continued, “And for those who want me to say that the only way you can honor John McCain, is to fight President Trump and try to kick him out of office, I don’t agree. I’m going to do what I think is best for the country, using what John taught me about the country.” Graham then discussed his hope that Trump would consider war-hawk John McCain’s suggestions about what to do in Syria.Watch:“When he says something bad about John, it pisses me off,"" says Sen.

It sometimes is a little depressing.If you are over 40, you probably remember Robert Reich. He was Bill Clinton’s Labor Secretary. He was a liberal among moderates in that administration, but a thoughtful and engaging person. His views weren’t mainstream, but he certainly wasn’t stupid or a hater.Well, that was all before Trump. Like a lot of people in our ruling class, Robert Reich is now a completely different person. Just the other day, Reich wrote that the entire Trump presidency ought to be annulled. Not just ended prematurely, that’s no longer radical enough, but erased from history, forgotten by decree.America must reset to the first Monday in November 2016 like none of it ever happened. We have to retroactively Photoshop an awful lot of pictures. But according to Reich, it’s the only remedy.Reality isn’t tolerable, it should be banned. Reich was dead serious apparently. Keep in mind that 20 years ago, people considered him impressive. Some still do, which tells you a lot about the state of our intellectual leaders.People still defend John Brennan too, even after he revealed on television that there’s something seriously wrong with him. Officials who run the CIA ought to be sober and reasonable and even-tempered.It’s too powerful a job, with too little oversight, and too little accountability for a wacko. That would be dangerous for the country. And yet, over the weekend, there was Brennan once again charging a political opponent with a death penalty offense on the basis of zero evidence.Things are accelerating fast. Trump is a racist, became Trump as a traitor, which has now become Trump as a non-person who must be erased from our collective memory. The Left is officially out of epithets. All that’s left is physical harm. Who will be the first to call for that; it feels inevitable at this point.GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN IN NOVEMBER!",fake

Didn’t tell the court the guy who wrote it, Christopher Steele had been terminated. And now it appears they knew about Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr’s involvement and didn’t tell the court that either.

Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee’s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the “dossier.” Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn’t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it — which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn’t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we’re sure the main stream media will ignore it.

He’s attempting to challenge GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in the upcoming midterm elections, but what Beto just said about the national anthem may have been all it takes for people to lock their vote in for Cruz. Republicans are going after Beto fairly hard after his statement which specifically said that there is “nothing more American” than kneeling during the national anthem. He might be trying to make a point, but if he’s taken a look at what happened to the NFL when players began taking a knee, and the dwindling ratings, the boos, and everything else that negatively points at the take a knee protests, then he might have known better to talk about it. Perhaps Beto would have been better off not talking about the national anthem at all. Now he’s facing the wrath of Americans who love their flag, their country and dislike anyone disrespecting it one way or another.Fox News reported “Comments like his are a slap in the face to every man and woman who has ever served our nation and put their lives on the line to defend American values,” Republican Party of Texas Chairman James Dickey said Thursday.O’Rourke, a Democratic congressman, was asked at a recent campaign event about NFL players who kneel during the anthem.

762,22-Aug-18,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNWSSLkFagMThis morning, President Trump slammed his former lawyer Michael Cohen in a pretty accurate tweet that called Cohen’s ability as a lawyer into question:If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 22, 2018On July 26, 2018,  Fox News  reported that Michael Cohen could be facing new professional and legal challenges for leaking a secretly recorded conversation with his former client Donald Trump — a risky move that could cause problems with the state bar, future clients, and even investigators.Cohen, who served as a Trump Organization attorney for more than a decade and has described himself as President Trump’s “fixer,” has sought to distance himself from his client and close friend in recent weeks—though the leak drew the starkest line in the sand between the two.Cohen’s attorney, Clinton confidant Lanny Davis, released to CNN the tape which had a recording of a discussion between Trump and Cohen about potentially buying the rights to Playboy model Karen McDougal’s story claiming an affair with Trump.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Cohen reportedly has felt hung out to dry by the president, and this was part of his attempt to punch back.New York Post reports- Sources say Cohen thought he deserved to be campaign manager when Paul Manafort was ousted. He later thought he should be Trump’s chief of staff or White House counsel.“He’s bitter Trump didn’t give him a job,” said an insider.One insider says Cohen used to tell people he went to law school in Michigan, implying he got his degree from the highly rated University of Michigan.In fact, Cohen graduated from the Thomas M. Cooley Law School, now affiliated with Western Michigan University and recently ranked the worst law school in the country by the National Advisory Council for Law School Transparency.But the move could cause problems for Cohen beyond the president’s angry tweets, as experts raise questions of ethical violations.Trump attorney and longtime friend, Rudy Giuliani, is hitting back at the unethical lawyer…questioning his credibility.Giuliani tweeted some very interesting questions for Americans to consider: If Cohen is telling the truth why are he and Lanny Davis misrepresenting the language from President Trump “Do not pay by cash…CHECK.” And why are they leaking falsely privileged and confidential information? So much for ethics!If Cohen is telling the truth why are he and Lanny Davis misrepresenting the language from President Trump “Do not pay by cash…CHECK.” And why are they leaking falsely privileged and confidential information.

We’ve set up a website, MichaelCohenTruthFund.com, to help him tell the truth about Donald Trump. We need help, and Michael is asking for anybody interested in helping him to go to this website that we’ve just set up … We do ask everybody who is interested in Michael being able to tell the truth to help him out.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]HELSINKI WAS A TURNING POINT? WE CALL BS ON ALL OF THIS!Cohen continued…”It was evolutionary. I can tell you that Helsinki was a significant turning point as he worried about the future of our country, with the President of the United States aligning with somebody who everybody in his intelligence community who he appointed, including Dan Coats, said that Putin interfered and tried to help Trump get elected, and Trump is the only one left denying that, and that shook up Mr. Cohen.”MARK LEVIN WIEGHED IN ON LANNY DAVIS LAST NIGHT IN A CLASSIC TAKEDOWN:“The Great One” Mark Levin spoke about the Cohen case on Hannity last night and blew the case by Lanny Devis to smithereens! We love how he starts out with “The general counsel for the Clinton mob family…” LOL!TRANSCRIPT:The general counsel for the Clinton mob family, Lanny Davis, he had his client pleaded two counts of criminality that don’t exist. These campaign finance violations that is all over TV, they are saying implicates the president of the United States directly.First, let’s back up. It is a guilty plea. It is a plea bargain between a prosecutor and a criminal. A criminal who doesn’t want to spend the rest of his life in prison. That is not precedent. That applies only to that specific case. Nobody cites plea bargains for precedent. That’s number one.Number two, just because a prosecutor says that somebody violated a campaign law doesn’t make it so. He is not the judge. He is not the jury. We didn’t adjudicate anything. It never went to court. That’s number two.A campaign expenditure under our federal campaign laws is an expenditure solely for campaign activity. A candidate who spends his own money or even corporate money for an event that occurred not as a result of the campaign, it is not a campaign expenditure.Let me give a few examples to help people understand this, especially the American people. Let’s say, I wrote these down. Let’s say a candidate had said we owe vendors a whole lot of money. We’ve had disputes with them. But I want you to go ahead and pay them. I’m a candidate, I don’t want all this negative publicity.So he says to his private lawyer, you pay them, I’ll reimburse you, get it done. Is that illegal? It’s perfectly legal.Yet according to the prosecution of the Southern District of New York it’s paid at the direction of the candidate to influence the election. Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, how stupid is your point? It’s not a crime.More, let’s say that this candidate settles a lawsuit that was initiated before he becomes a candidate. And he says to his personal lawyer, I want you to pay, settle that lawsuit. You can use my corporate funds, my private funds, whatever it is. That is perfectly legal, too.The prosecutor would say, but that influenced the election. So what? There are certain things you do that influence an election that are legal and certain things you do to influence an election that are illegal.Let’s say a candidate gets a non-disclosure agreement from a disgruntled employee, and he wants to quiet that disgruntled employee as he goes into the election. He pays the funds out of his pocket or through his corporation. Perfectly legal.Nothing here was spent out of the campaign. Nothing was done with the campaign or to the campaign. This is exactly what the federal law is.And Mr. Lanny Davis had his client plead guilty to two offenses that aren’t offenses that the prosecutor insisted were offenses. That’s why he is no good. That is Michael Cohen against Donald Trump.Donald Trump is in the clear. Let’s say Donald Trump even directed Michael Cohen to make payments in non-disclosure agreements. So what? He is allowed to do that.Now, here’s my question. Has the Southern District of New York ever paid money in a non-disclosure agreement with any of its employees? How about any U.S. attorney’s office in the United States? How about the Department of Justice? How about any business?HANNITY: Or Congress.LEVIN: How about any union? How about the DNC? How about a member of Congress? It’s done all the time. It is all hush money. And all of this hush money, they can’t pay hush money. Well, it is hush money. It’s legal. It’s a contract. It’s done all the time.Now, what does Mr. Mueller have left? It’s worked. He is chasing the Manhattan madam. Who the hell is the Manhattan madam? I don’t know. And how is he interviewing? He is dragging her in front of the grand jury.What’s next? The Manhattan madam. He’s got — he’s got Manafort where he wants him on banking charges, he set up a few guys like Flynn who has gotten in trouble. Now they have Cohen. What do they have? They have nothing. I’ll tell you what they have.Mr. Mueller as a federal prosecutor is preparing his impeachment report which is an unconstitutional activity. Mr. Mueller is supposed to be non-political. He is not supposed to preparing impeachment report.Mr. Mueller, I told you before, you can’t indict a sitting president. I told you that 15 months ago. Now you figured it out. You and Rosenstein figured it out. Now you and Rosenstein are trying to figure out what to do with the subpoena.You see, Sean, Giuliani was on your show the other day or somebody’s show and said why do they take two or three weeks? I’ll tell you why they take two or three weeks. Because Mr. Mueller has to consult Mr. Rosenstein, his boss, to figure out what to do with the subpoena.I’ll tell you what happens when they issue that subpoena. The president of the United States takes it all the way to the Supreme Court. And what does he cite? Department of Justice memos. What else does he cite? The Constitution of the United States.So this is going to be an impeachment battle in the end. The president of the United States if he doesn’t get involved in the perjury trap — think about that. They don’t have a crime. He needs this interview to create a crime against the president of the United States. This prosecutor.Well, that’s pretty damn outrageous. So, in any event, I want the news media to understand. You know what took place in the Southern District of New York? Nothing that matters. Zippo.HANNITY: You know what, Mark?LEVIN: There was no violation of the federal campaign laws. Lanny Davis blew it. Lanny Davis — Lanny Davis he puts out a tweet today. “Today, Cohen stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime.”You are a dummy, Lanny.“By making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election. If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen then why wouldn’t they be a crime for Donald Trump?”They weren’t a crime for Michael Cohen. He screwed himself. And they’re not a crime for Donald Trump either. Now move along and go back into your corner with Hillary Clinton.",fake
764,22-Aug-18,"The left just can’t admit fault or defeat…Yesterday was a sad day for America when we found out that Mollie Tibbetts had been murdered by an illegal alien from Mexico. It was devastating to know that her death could have been 100% preventable had this man not been allowed to be in America illegally.While the sadness and devastation was felt by most Americans, the heartlessness from the leftist media  surfaced and reared it’s ugly head. In case you missed it, frequent MSNBC guest Christina Greer politicized the death of Mollie Tibbetts in the worst way possible:The frequent MSNBC guest and Fordham University professor Christina Greer has been known to say outrageous things on-air (see below) before but this takes the cake.

Here are just a few:Dr. Christina Greer, a professor of Political Science at Fordham University said that the US is ” a patriarchal, white supremacist country.”She made the claim that President Trump has been “lying, cheating and stealing his whole life.”She also said that white women choose patriarchy over they own interests and Democracy is set up to protect white women’All you have to do is Google this woman and you’ll find numerous outrageous comments from her.If I had a child going to Fordham, I would speak up about this hateful person working there.JUST IN CASE YOU JUST WANT TO CONTACT FORDHAM: FORDHAM WEBSITENews guests like this are the new cable news so-called “experts” who are nothing more than hateful radical leftists who editorialize like crazy.

Ellis III, after he received threats related to the ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s fraud case that he’s currently residing over.Fox News reports that Judge Ellis also refused a media request to release juror information.U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, in rejecting the motion, argued that he’s confident the jurors would be threatened as well if their information were to be made public.“I can tell you there have been [threats]. … I don’t feel right if I release their names,” he said, adding that because of threats against him, “The Marshals go where I go.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The startling revelation came as the jury completed its second day of deliberations without a verdict. The jury will reconvene Monday.Ellis, a famously prickly judge known for his colorful comments, has attracted considerable attention during the Manafort trial for his frequent sparring with the attorneys — particularly those on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team.In a motion filed in federal court on Thursday, CNN and several other media outlets requested that the court release the names and home addresses of all jurors in the Paul Manafort fraud case. Jurors haven not yet rendered a verdict on any of the 18 charges against Manafort, who briefly served as President Donald Trump’s campaign manager in 2016.The motion — filed on behalf of CNN, Washington Post, BuzzFeed, POLITICO, New York Times, NBC Universal, and the Associated Press — asks the court to provide to the media organizations the full names and home addresses of the men and women who were summoned and selected by the federal government to serve as jurors in Manafort’s fraud case.“Crime and Justice” reporter Shimon Prokupecz tweeted:The judge will hold a hearing on a motion by CNN and media organizations to unseal the names and addresses of jurors as well as other parts of the trial that are currently secret.“A thirsty press is essential in a free country,” the Judge said in announcing the hearing.— Shimon Prokupecz (@ShimonPro) August 17, 2018https://twitter.com/ShimonPro/status/1030454995861295104?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwThe media request for the names and home addresses of jurors comes a day after the jury began deliberating about the verdicts on 18 fraud and conspiracy counts against Manafort. The charges, which are unrelated to Manafort’s work for the Trump campaign in 2016, were brought by the federal Office of Special Counsel, which is headed by former FBI director Robert Mueller. Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate allegations that the Trump campaign committed treason by illegally conspiring with Russian government officials to steal the presidential election from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",fake

775,16-Aug-18,"Democrat James Clyburn  is the third ranking Congressman behind Pelosi. If that wasn’t scary enough, he just offered to pursue  the speakership from Pelosi if the Democrats win the House back. Don’t do us any favors!  Clyburn is the same age as Pelosi! They’re both 78 and have been lifers in Congress sparking the call for term limits!Over 50 Democrats have pledged that they won’t support Pelosi’s speakership if they win back the House. So who would take Pelosi’s place? Clyburn has a track record of racism that goes way back. He’ll only bring the Democrats back to victimhood instead of moving forward.When John Conyers was in hot water for sexual harassment, Clyburn pulled the race card:“James Clyburn compared Conyers’ accusers to the child murderer Susan Smith, who initially claimed a black man had abducted her kids. Clyburn said, these are all white women who’ve made these charges against Conyers,” Robert Draper tweeted.When asked if that comment was true, Draper said he verified it through two sources, adding “Clyburn has used the Susan Smith parallel more than once, to members & staffers.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]One of the most racist things Clyburn did is refuse to denounce hate preacher Louis Farrakhan:Democrats who are members of the Congressional Black Caucus have continuously refused to denounce hateful racist Louis Farrakhan. The Nation of Islam leader spews hate speech from the pulpit to THOUSANDS of believers yet it’s crickets from the main stream media.

Heck, we’re still uncovering hidden truths about Obama that would have been great for the voter to know. Like the meeting and photo with Farrakhan that was hidden until Obama was out of office?

776,16-Aug-18,"US Rep. and DNC Vice Chair Keith Ellison (D-MN) sat down for an interview with local television station WCCO-TV where he discussed the domestic abuse allegation that was leveled against him by his former Democrat activist girlfriend, Karen Monahan. Prior to the interview, the TV hosts told their viewers Ellison would be speaking about the #MeToo claims against him.  #MeToo refers to sexual abuse or sexual misconduct against a woman by a male in power, so why would the hosts use this watered down social media hashtag to refer to the serious allegations against the Democrat candidate for Attorney General In Minnesota?The outspoken, Muslim US Congressman, Keith Ellison, who frequently trashes President Trump, appears to be very measured and can be seen looking to the side while responding to the interviewer about physical and verbal abuse allegations.When asked directly if there was video that shows him dragging her off a bed and screaming obsenities at her, Ellison paused, and then responded, “There couldn’t be. There couldn’t be such a thing as that”. That’s not exactly a direct answer to the question.Ellison told the interviewer that if he had the chance to talk to her he would say, “Look, we loved each other. We don’t have to destroy each other.” We’re pretty sure Monahan is not be destroyed by DNC Vice Chair, Keith Ellison.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]When Hillary paraded her accused rapist and serial sexual assaulter husband around as a prop during her 2016 presidential bid, the media refused to acknowledge the serious accusations about former President Bill Clinton’s sexual predator past, or Hillary’s part in either shaming his victims, or looking the other way. For the past 5 months, members of the Democrat Party have used an allegation by porn star Stormy Daniels from over a decade ago, of an alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump, as a way to assassinate his character. When the mainstream media wasn’t covering the phony Trump-Russian election collusion story, Stormy Daniels was at the epicenter of their endless anti-Trump news coverage. But when the son of a Democrat activist came forward with allegations that he and his brother found a video showing DNC Vice Chair and Democrat Representative Keith Ellison, dragging their mother off the bed, while screaming and calling her a: “f*cking bitch” and telling her to get the f*ck out of his house” the DNC and the mainstream media suddenly lost their nerve to speak out about a horrific domestic violence claim.The allegations came to light after Monahan’s son posted a comment on Facebook about the abuse he witnessed when he accidentally came across a video while on his mother’s computer.Here is the claim that was made by Sierra ClubSierra Club activist and Democrat Karen Monahan’s son, Austin Aslim Monahan’s Facebook post:Please read, if you care about my mother please share.I love you momma, you wont have to stand…Posted by Austin Aslim Monahan on Saturday, August 11, 2018“Please read, if you care about my mother please share.

For several months we knew something wasn’t right and couldn’t figure it out. When we asked our mom if everything was ok, she told us she was dealing with some stress and would be ok.In the middle of 2017, I was using my moms computer trying to download something and I clicked on a file, I found over 100 text and twitters messages and video almost 2 min long that showed Keith Ellison dragging my mama off the bed by her feet, screaming and calling her a “fucking bitch” and telling her to get the fuck out of his house. The messages I found, were mixed with him consistently telling my mom he wanted her back, he missed her, he knew he fucked up and we wished he could do things different, he would victim shaming, bully her, and threaten her if she went public. I text him and told him I know what you did to my mama and a few other things.I met up with my mom that night and asked her what happened. She said nothing happened until I told her I saw a video and hell of a lot of messages saying something different. She finally talked. My brother and I were so angry and hurt for our mom. We were ready to go public but our mom begged us not to and she along with others convinced us it wasn’t in our moms best interest.I saw message after message through out all that time, where my mom was telling him she wasn’t going back to him but still saw his humanity and offered restorative justice. I honestly don’t see how she would offer him that, but thats her choice.Sitting all this time, watching what our mom went through and not being able to say or do anything was hard as hell. None of you know the hell our family has gone through. I don’t think half of you would even care. We watched her so called political friends stand by say or do nothing. People had an idea what happened and never reached out to my mom. The same people who are posting about social justice are ready to smear my mom, protect a person who abused her and broke the law. You think we give a shit about a politics when we saw what our mom went through? She may not matter to none of you, but she is our mom, our kids grandmother and she is actually someone. There is a lot more he has done to my mom and others that we saw in the text but our mom can decide if and when she wants to tell the world that part.Whether we saw the video or read all those messages, we still would have believed her if she had told us. #IbelieveherMy mom has always tried to protect me and my brother. She doesn’t have to protect us anymore and we aren’t letting her stand alone. When we found out our mom was planning on sharing her story, that is all we needed to hear for us to share ours and stand with our mom. You want to smear someone, try to lie about a person who didn’t do shit to deserve the ongoing emotional, physical abuse, smear me and my brother.I use to believe the Democrats were the ones who would stand by a person who went through this kind of abuse, now I know both Democrats and Republicans could care less when it comes to violence toward women and girls.I have learned a lot about how patriarchy has shaped me as a 25 year old through all this. I just became a father and I am working on how patriarchy influenced thoughts ad decisions I have made as a young man so I can teach my son better. I am starting today by standing with my mom, my sons grandma. It is not just on women and girls to speak out, it is on men to do some of the emotional work. I’m not here to prove shit to anyone, I’m just stating facts. You can take it or leave it.

Lovinger, a 12-year strategic affairs analyst with the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment (ONA), has been on loan to the NSC since January when he was picked for the position by then-National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn.Lovinger was notified in a letter from the Pentagon on Monday that his Top-Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS-SCI) clearance had been suspended and that he had to return to the Pentagon.The letter cited unspecified outside activities by Lovinger. The notice said the suspension was approved by Kevin Sweeney, chief of staff for Defense Secretary James Mattis.One official said Lovinger was targeted by Trump opponents because of his conservative views and ties to Flynn, specifically his past association with the Flynn Intel Group, Inc., a consulting business.Flynn was forced out as national security adviser in February after top-secret intelligence communications intercepts were disclosed to the press revealing he had discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak.Disclosure of the clearance suspension followed a report in the Washington Free Beacon Monday stating the security clearance process at the White House has been politicized by government officials opposed to Trump and his advisers.Suspending or revoking clearances is a frequent tactic used by government officials to sideline officials whose views and policies they oppose.According to the Washington Times,  Mr. Lovinger filed a whistleblower reprisal complaint in May with the Defense Department inspector general against James Baker, director of the Office of Net Assessment. The complaint also singles out Washington Headquarters Services, a Pentagon support agency that awarded the Halper contracts totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars.Mr. Bigley filed a complaint July 18 with the Pentagon’s senior ethics official, charging that Mr. Lovinger’s superiors misused the security clearance process to punish him. He said his client complained about excessive “sweetheart” deals for Mr. Halper and for a “best friend” of Chelsea Clinton.“As it turns out, one of the two contractors Mr. Lovinger explicitly warned his ONA superiors about misusing in 2016 was none other than Mr. Halper,” Mr. Bigley wrote in his ethics complaint, which called the contracts “cronyism and corruption.”During President Obama’s administration, the FBI took the momentous step of recruiting a national security academic, Stefan Halper, to spy on Trump associates by striking up what seemed to be innocent professional contacts.Mr. Halper was a “confidential human source,” an official category of spy that is regulated by the FBI’s domestic investigations directive. ",fake

Hildebrand says he grew up listening to the band’s music and was excited to attend one of their shows, but never thought he’d leave bloody and bruised at the hands of a famous musician.Cellphone video taken at the concert captures the moment the Social Distortion fan says he was beaten up by the band’s frontman, 56-year-old Mike Ness.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Ness, 56, had been criticizing President Trump on stage, and Hildebrand – a Republican – didn’t like it.“I pretty much said I paid for your music, not your politics,” said the farmer from rural Galt, Calif., about 30 miles away from Sactown. “I stood pretty much with my silent protest with my middle finger up for the next two songs.”Cell phone video of the incident appears to show Ness motioning for the man to come forward – before the singer spit on him.Then Ness puts his guitar down and wades into the crowd and gets into a tussle that’s obscured from the camera’s view.The crowd cheered on Ness with at least one fan screaming: “Whip his ass, Mike!”Hildebrand described the melee: “(Ness) takes his guitar off, jumps off the stage and proceeds to punch me multiple times in the head.”“I wasn’t able to defend myself because people in the crowd were holding me back,” said Hildebrand, claiming he was then thrown out of the venue by security.Watch:",fake

We reported on this outrageous effort (see our previous report below) to drain the coffers of the gun rights organization and people didn’t believe it…Well, listen to what he says he’s going to do to bankrupt the NRA:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zrq9-_Ynq24NY Governor Andrew Cuomo told Joe Scarborough “Look, I think these guys are bad guys”  during a discussion on a battle the state of New York and the NRA are in the middle of.Cuomo then accused the NRA of bullying, “But, look, from my point of view, I do disagree with the NRApolitically, and if they have less money to bully and threaten politicians into irrational positions, you know, I’m not going to lose any sleep over that. And if they went away, you know, I would offer my thoughts and prayers, Joe.”The governor has engaged in campaigns to pressure businesses to break ties with the NRA.Even worse, Cuomo has stated he will push for other states to follow his lead on trying to destroy the NRA:“When they said that loss of this insurance product is going to make such a significant difference on their revenues, I am now reaching out to the other states because I believe this insurance product is going to be illegal from a public policy point of view in most states and now that the NRA said this is a major source of revenue, I’m going to pursue it nationwide.”“Look, I think these guys are bad guys, and it started from the Clinton administration with the SAFE Act that could have done great work, that the gun manufacturers supported until the NRA came in and literally pressured the gun manufacturers not to make an arrangement.”OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE NRA’S FIGHT WITH CUOMO:The Rolling Stone website reported on the details of a court-filed document that appears to be an amended complaint alleging that the National Rifle Association (NRA) may be facing “irrecoverable loss and irreparable harm” and the potential inability of not being able to access financial services that are stated to be essential to its operations.This is mostly speaking about the NRA’s loss of insurance coverages and alleged harms done by the potentially abusive New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The NRA has been suing Cuomo and believes their association is involved in a “blacklisting campaign” and that it might have caused “tens of millions of dollars” worth of damages to the association. Losing that much money over legal battles could certainly affect the funds needed for daily operations. Legal battles might also push insurance agencies away as they would likely not want to provide any sort of coverages for a company undergoing current legal issues or “preexisting conditions.”Is this a Democratic way to violate the much loved NRA and an attempt to tie them up in court so long that they run out of money?Rolling Stone reported: “Insurance coverage is necessary for the NRA to continue its existence,” the complaint reads. Without general liability coverage, it adds, the “NRA cannot maintain its physical premises, convene off-site meetings and events, operate educational programs … or hold rallies, conventions and assemblies.”The entertainment publication also mentioned that the complaint spoke about how the NRA may have to close operations on their magazines and video streaming services, also stating that the NRATV might also be forced to end operations. This is mostly just a warning so far, but the NRA appears to be bracing for a heavy struggle and the absolute worst case scenario if they’re financially unable to continue with their normal daily operations. If they continue losing funds over legal battles with the New York Democrat, then certain programs by the NRA will slowly be deactivated until they’re able to recover from whatever funds they might lose in their legal struggles and if they’re unable to secure the proper insurances they need to operate correctly.The lawsuit can be read on this link and it suggests that the financial risks are “catastrophic.” It also mentions that New York’s government is being accused of trying to silence an advocate for constitutional rights. The NRA seeks to protect the second amendment and it appears as though they believe the problems arising from New York are an attempt to crush an advocate of the constitution, particularly the second amendment and bearing arms.Rolling Stone continued that the “lawsuit stems from actions taken by New York financial regulators to halt the sale of an illegal, NRA-branded insurance policy. The NRA actively marketed “Carry Guard,” a policy to reimburse members for legal costs incurred after firing a legal gun. In May, the state of New York found that Carry Guard “unlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for certain acts of intentional wrongdoing.” The NRA’s insurance partners agreed to stop selling the policies and pay a $7 million fine.The NRA complaint alleges that New York was not content to block this single insurance product, but instead campaigned to sever the NRA’s ties to a wide range of financial service providers, from insurance companies to banks.”Overspending in 2016 didn’t help, but then the Parkland Florida massacre and the amount of blame incorrectly placed on the NRA didn’t help either. After the shooting at the Florida school, it was anti-2A activists who spoke out about the NRA, even though the NRA had nothing to do with the shooting or any school shootings. The NRA became the poster-child of blame and it seemed to be far-left protesters and activists who placed more blame on the NRA than the actual shooter and the cowardly Broward police who failed to respond to an active shooter in a way that could have saved lives.It was Cuomo who urged, via Twitter, for companies in New York to basically cut ties with the NRA if they had any prior relationship with them. Cuomo suggests that people consider their reputation and responsibility. Interestingly enough, if the NRA was responsible for mass shootings, then there would probably be more of them. It appears that the NRA members are actually the more responsible group when it comes to firearms, training, and safety. Cuomo may have made more sense if he targeted his vengeful spite towards criminals who harm innocent people, but he seems to have gone after law-abiding citizens instead – just because they like guns and embrace their American freedom to own.The complaint from the NRA states that Cuomo and his anti-2A actions are a “malicious conspiracy to stifle the NRA’s speech and induce a boycott of the NRA” as well as “suppressing the NRA’s pro-Second Amendment viewpoint” and had engaged in “unlawful conduct with the intent to obstruct, chill, deter, and retaliate against the NRA’s core political speech.”The company who provided insurance to the NRA broke up with them like a puberty-raging couple in high school and even said they’re basically not ever, ever, getting back together.The NRA also now struggles to find banks willing to do business with them, which is odd because the NRA seems to run a very legitimate business, but perhaps banks are scared to support an American group who loves the constitution and would prefer not to make their bitter angry liberal customers bent out of shape.If the NRA and all their guns were such a big problem, then we’d know it by now.Why does the NRA keep taking the blame for crimes they don’t commit?",fake

New York Times Editor Sarah Jeong  is a perfect example of what the “hate machines” called colleges are producing.MacDonald discusses how the students are bombarded with messages that teach them to feel like victims of racism and sexism. They’re taught to feel quilt over their “whiteness”. Campuses across the country grab the children and fill them with cultural Marxist ideology so that by Thanksgiving you’re wondering who this child is sitting across from you.Mac Donald addressed this issue more extensively in a recent column for National Review:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Sarah Jeong Is a Boring, Typical Product of the American AcademyThe most significant feature of Sarah Jeong, the New York Times’ embattled new editorial board member, is not that she is a “racist,” as her critics put it. It is that she is an entirely typical product of the contemporary academy…The key features of Jeong’s worldview are an obsession with whiteness and its alleged sins; a commitment to the claim that we live in a rape culture; and a sneering contempt for objectivity and truth-seeking. These are central tenets of academic victimology. From the moment freshmen arrive on a college campus, they are inundated by the message that they are either the bearers of white privilege or its victims. College presidents and the metastasizing diversity bureaucracy teach students to see racism where none exists, preposterously accusing their own institutions of systemic bias. “Bias response teams,” confidential “discrimination hotlines,” and implicit-bias training for faculty and staff roll forth from university coffers in wild abandon.UC Berkeley’s Division of Equity and Inclusion until recently hung banners throughout campus reminding students of their place in the ruthlessly competitive hierarchy of victimhood. One particularly lachrymose entry, featuring a female black and a Hispanic male student, urged the presumably “non-diverse” sector of Berkeley to “create an environment where people other than yourself can exist.” This year’s White Privilege Conference, a nationwide academic gathering, featured panels on “Breaking the Chains of Capitalism and White Supremacy,” the “Whiteness of Law,” and “How Whiteness Kills.”WHY SHOULD YOUR TAX DOLLARS BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE THESE COLLEGES?

How dare he? He has taken this country to its knees. We already have racism raining down all over America. The only way we can stop him and stop all of this foolishness and all of this hate and all of this racism that’s raining down on America is we’ve got to send a blue wave through this country in the midterms.

She was fired by John Kelly and turned around to bad mouth everyone in the White House including President Trump. It’s why when President Trump was asked about her yesterday that he called her a “lowlife”.She decided to score with a cash grab trash novel about her time in the White House with claims of threats and racism. She continues to slander the Trump administration in a case of sour grapes like we’ve never seen before.The problem with her claims is that they’ve all been shot down (see below) or dismissed as silly.

785,13-Aug-18,"Omarosa Manigault Newman is JILTED to the core over something! From what we’re seeing on “Hardball” with Chris Matthews, it seems like Omarosa thinks she’s going to knock a home run over the Boston wall. She claims that Robert Mueller’s office has reached out to her. She then stated that she was willing to give them anything they want. Anything? I can’t tell if she’s talking about important information, secretly recorded videos or audio tapes (that could possibly be a violation of the law), or if she’s playing tricks to get what she wants. Can’t be too sure about things today. It’s like she’s going on tour trying to make a name for herself for working against President Donald Trump. She even thinks he will be impeached after what she allegedly might have to share.Was she breaking laws by secretly recording people in the White House or other locations? She seems like she wants to release tapes but she’s taking this little “look what I have” tour to see who’s willing to pay the most or set her up with another job.  Then again, she does have a book being released soon, so maybe she’s just talking up her name by causing whatever commotions she can think of..@OMAROSA says she'll cooperate with Robert Mueller's office if they call her again. #Hardball pic.twitter.com/4crEwVZqcS— Hardball (@hardball) August 13, 2018The Hill stated the following about her talk on “Hardball” with Chris Matthews: “Manigault Newman appeared Monday on MNSBC’s “Hardball” as part of her ongoing press tour for her new White House memoir. Asked by host Chris Matthews if she has tapes from her time working in the Trump administration beyond the two she has shared publicly in recent days, Manigault Newman said, “I have plenty.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“Anything Mueller would like to see?” Matthews asked.“If his office calls again… anything they want I’ll share,” Manigault Newman responded. “Anything that they want, I’ll certainly cooperate.”The ex-communications director for the White House’s Office of Public Liaison did not elaborate on what her previous interactions with the special counsel may have involved.Asked if she believes Trump will be impeached, Manigault Newman said “at this point, yes.”Impeached? For what? What exactly is on those tapes that she claims to have? Was that her plan all along? To seem like someone the White House could trust, and then become a huge portion of the swamp by potentially illegally recording people and then using that information against them?It gets worse. Omarosa also claims to have secretly recorded Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.Politico dove into this head first, stating that Omarosa basically has a “stash of recordings” and condolences by both Ivanka and Jared. It seems like people we cozy with her and may not have known she was being fired. Of course, that’s how it might seem for now.Then they jump into Omarosa and her claims about Trump using the “N-Word” and it being recorded by multiple people, yet no tape like that has come out yet. If that tape existed, then you know for sure people would have released it by now. That would send shockwaves across the nation. Except, where is the tape of Trump saying the “N-Word” and why hasn’t Trump been accused of being racist until he defeated Hillary in the election of 2016? All those years as a celebrity and we didn’t hear a peep about Donald Trump and racism in the same sentence.Manigault Newman’s claim about the new tape provides additional confirmation that she was looking to build a case not only against Trump, whom she alleges has been recorded by others using the N-word, but also against his top aides and family members. Though she said the president dispatched Kelly to push her out of the White House, she has also argued that “Donald Trump has no idea what’s going on in the White House.”Going after the Trump family isn’t enough. It seems like Omarosa is swinging that proverbial sword towards others as well. In particular, John Kelly, the man who fired her. He’s the chief of staff and Omarosa doesn’t seem to fond of him right now.Politico continued, specifically speaking about Omarosa’s chat on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” stating: “Manigault Newman’s primary target may be the president, but she has also taken shots at Kelly, arguing that he intimidated her and threatened to destroy her reputation. She released a tape Sunday, recorded in the White House Situation Room, on which Kelly can be heard urging her to leave the White House without a fuss.“I’d like to see this be a friendly departure,” Kelly says on the tape. “There are pretty significant legal issues that we hope don’t develop into something that, that’ll make it ugly for you.”People who are fired usually leave peacefully and use their previous job on their resume. When Kelly is talking about those legal issues, then perhaps he’s talking about people being secretly recorded and going after her for that, although we can’t be 100% certain unless he states specifics.At this point, Omarosa might not be employable by many as people could fear that she can’t be trusted. She might be making all this fuss in hopes that selling a book could provide her with enough income to get by. Her book is titled “Unhinged” and set to release on August 14, 2018.I’m not buying it.I don’t have any interest in reading a book by someone who has become so unhinged themselves that they’re distrustfully throwing the White House under the bus just to spark their own career.

788,11-Aug-18,"A majority of city council members in Chicago want to give out free money to citizens even though the city is strapped for cash. They want  Mayor Rahm Emanuel to form a task force to look into Universal Basic Income where the people would get a government check with no strings attached aka free money on the backs of the taxpayers.The typical amount would be $500 a month to 1,000 needy Chicago families. Those families would also get Earned Income Tax Credit money on a monthly basis instead of once a year.A rep for one of the Chicago Wards said that the program would “help working people and families become more resilient to day-to-day financial emergencies, are able to make rent, cover childcare, and put food on the table.”Obama endorsed Universal Basic Income during a speech in South Africa: “We’re going to have to be more imaginative. We’re going to have to consider new ways of thinking about these problems like a universal income, a review of our work week and how we train our young people.”More and more politicians are pushing socialism whereby citizens spread the wealth. Remember Joe the Plumber? Obama told Joe he believes in “spreading the wealth” way back then and is now pushing it around the world. It’s a globalists dream to take your hard-earned money and spread it around to other people.

Keith Ellison deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, recently praised the concept of a universal basic income, saying it “has a lot of merit.” We’d like to know how Ellison plans on paying for all Americans to basically receive an allowance for doing nothing (see more on this below)Ellison made the comment at a forum in Minneapolis:Ellison: Idea of Universal Basic Income ‘Has a Lot of Merit’Rep. Keith Ellison (D., Minn.), deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, recently praised the concept of a universal basic income, saying it ""has a lot of merit.""Ellison made the comment at a forum in Minneapolis, where he discussed the issue of people losing their jobs due to technological advancements.Read more here: https://bit.ly/2GTXFlcPosted by Washington Free Beacon on Thursday, March 29, 2018WFB reports:“I personally do think that universal basic income is a [sic] idea that has a lot merit,” Ellison said. “I don’t think that universal basic income means that people sit around; I think it means do other things that are necessary.”“There are things that are valuable and important that don’t necessarily have a market value that we should have people doing,” Ellison continued. “You know, like in the 1930s, we paid artists to basically document the Depression. We went out and had writers document rural life in America. There were still people who had been enslaved who were still living. During the Depression we paid people to go interview them so we can keep that knowledge, and you can go to the Library of Congress and listen to them today because of it.”“I think that it is a very important idea. I’ve written on it,” Ellison added. “I’ve actually thought about having a community meeting on universal basic income because I think it’s—to folks to who know anything about it, there’s a lot of unanswered questions.”Proposals for universal basic income programs can vary, but they generally involve the government ensuring that all citizens make a certain minimum amount of money every year, including people without an income.MORE ON UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME:Forget social security, medicaid and WIC, today’s progressives have moved well beyond discussing such entitlement relics of the past and nowadays dedicate their efforts to the concept of a “Universal Basic Income” for all…call it the New ‘New Deal’.  You know, because having to work for that “car in every garage and chicken in every pot” is just considered cruel and unusual punishment by today’s standards.Of course, it should come as little surprise that the progressive state of Hawaii, which depends on easily automatable jobs tied to the tourism industry, is among the first to pursue a Universal Basic Income for its residents.  And while the idea of passing out free money to everyone seems like a genius plan, if we understand it correctly, as CBS points out, there is just one catch…figuring out who will pay for it.
Driverless trucks. Factory robots. Delivery drones. Virtual personal assistants.As technological innovations increasingly edge into the workplace, many people fear that robots and machines are destined to take jobs that human beings have held for decades–a trend that is already happening in stores and factories around the country. For many affected workers, retraining might be out of reach —unavailable, unaffordable or inadequate.Over the past two decades, automation has reduced the need for workers, especially in such blue-collar sectors as manufacturing, warehousing and mining. Many of the jobs that remain demand higher education or advanced technological skills. It helps explain why just 55 percent of Americans with no more than a high school diploma are employed, down from 60 percent just before the Great Recession.Hawaii state lawmakers have voted to explore the idea of a universal basic income in light of research suggesting that a majority of waiter, cook and building cleaning jobs — vital to Hawaii’s tourism-dependent economy — will eventually be replaced by machines. The crucial question of who would pay for the program has yet to be determined. But support for the idea has taken root.“Our economy is changing far more rapidly than anybody’s expected,” said state Rep. Chris Lee, who introduced legislation to consider a guaranteed universal income.Lee said he felt it’s important “to be sure that everybody will benefit from the technological revolution that we’re seeing to make sure no one’s left behind.”Read more: Zero HedgeWe think it’s insane and that we already give so much to all of the freebie programs out there…this is over the top and like throwing money away!

She ended up attending public school 40 minutes north in Yorktown, and much of her life was defined by the 40-minute commute between school and her family in the Bronx.’Ocasio-Cortez also boasted on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show that President Donald Trump, born in Queens, wouldn’t know how to handle ‘a girl from the Bronx’ such as herself.Little-known before her shock Democratic primary defeat of 10-term Congressional incumbent Joe Crowley on Tuesday night, Ocasio-Cortez has featured her own hard-luck biography as a key selling point in her insurgent campaign.With New York’s 14th district, encompassing parts of the Bronx and Queens, leaning heavily Democrat, she is believed to be a shoo-in for the House in the November general election.Ocasio-Cortez was born in 1989 to parents Sergio Ocasio-Roman, who was born in New York City, and mother Blanca Ocasio-Cortez, a native of Puerto Rico.Her father, who tragically died from lung cancer in 2008, was an architect and the CEO of Kirschenbaum & Ocasio-Roman Architects, PC, which focused on remodeling and renovations.Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign biography describes her father as ‘a small business owner’.‘She grew up in a working-class household where her mother cleaned homes and everyone pitched in on the family business,’ the bio continues.Initially, the young family lived in Parkchester, a planned community of 171 mid-rise brick buildings in the Bronx.When she was about five, Ocasio-Cortez’s family moved to the house in Westchester County, a detail that the bio omits.The timing of the move is confirmed in a New York Times interview with mother Blanca Ocasio-Cortez, but the report does not address the discrepancy.The home, a single-story with a finished basement, most recently sold for $355,000 in 2016.

Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her DOJ husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee’s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the “dossier.” Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn’t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it — which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn’t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we’re sure the main stream media will ignore it.

NUTSTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]MILLER FAMOUSLY TOOK DOWN JIM ACOSTA ON IMMIGRATION:Stephen Miller got the best of Acosta when he schooled him on the Statue of Liberty! SOME BACKGROUND ON MILLER’S RISE TO TRUMP’S INNER CIRCLE:AL.com reports:When Jeff Sessions first looked at Stephen Miller, he saw potential in the recent Duke University graduate.Miller, then in his early 20s, took up an offer from the conservative author David Horowitz to visit Capitol Hill to introduce him to members of Congress. Horowitz believed that Miller, who penned conservative columns at Duke and in Horowitz’ Front Page Mag, would be a capable D.C. staffer. A meeting with Sessions was on the top of Miller’s Washington wish list.“What was supposed to be a 15-minute meeting became an hour-long meeting with the senator,” Stephen Boyd, Sessions’ former communications director who eventually hired Miller. “Sen. Sessions immediately saw that Stephen Miller was an extraordinary young man who had a deep grasp of conservative politics.”It wasn’t only Sessions who saw something in Miller.When Donald Trump takes the oath of office on Friday, the 31-year-old Miller will be one of the president’s closest confidants, serving as a senior White House advisor. That title, announced last month, comes after Miller worked as a senior policy advisor for the better part of a year on the Trump campaign. Trump also tasked Miller with writing his speech to the Republican National Convention, and initial reports indicated that Miller would be writing the inaugural address. The Trump camp is now saying that the president-elect wrote that one himself, although New York Magazine poked some holes in that claim.While Sessions did not have an opening for Miller at the time of that first meeting nearly 10 years ago, he told Boyd to put him on his radar.“He came out and he said to me, ‘I want you to keep an eye on him and see if he can be a part of our team one day,'” Boyd recalled. After working as a press secretary to two House members, Miller was hired as a communications staffer on the Judiciary Committee, where Sessions was the top Republican.“I remember setting up a staff and it was Friday afternoon, and I got the go-ahead to hire a press secretary just to work on Judiciary. [Sessions’] directions were very clear and he and I discussed it – that it was obvious this was a kid with a lot of talent,” Boyd said.Miller would move up the ranks from a Judiciary Committee staffer to press secretary for Sessions’ office, eventually rising to communications director when Boyd departed to become chief of staff to Rep. Martha Roby, R-Montgomery, in 2012. Miller could not be reached for this story.On the surface, there didn’t seem to be much in common between Sessions, who grew up near Selma, and Miller, who was raised in liberal Southern California.The turning point for Miller came after the Sept. 11 attacks, when he was disgusted with how his high school in Santa Monica ridiculed President George W. Bush and how the liberal-leaning faculty banned conservatives like Horowitz and talk show host Larry Elder from speaking at the school but allowed “leftists and a Communist” to address the student body, according to an interview he gave to the Los Angeles Times.“During that dreadful time of national tragedy, anti-Americanism had spread all over the school like a rash,” Miller wrote in a 2003 essay, “How I Changed My Left Wing High School,” which Horowitz published. “The co-principal broadcasted his doubts about the morality of the air strikes against the Taliban to the entire school via the PA system. One teacher even dragged the American flag across the floor as we were sending off brave young men to risk their lives for it. It was then that I first took action, writing to prized radio personality Larry Elder. He invited me to discuss these issues on his program, which immediately drew the ire of the teachers, administrators, and even my fellow students. Their resistance only strengthened my resolve.”Miller continued his conservative advocacy at Duke, when he gained attention for defending the white lacrosse players accused of raping a black stripper (the players were ultimately exonerated) at a time when public opinion was against them. His position led to appearances on cable news, further raising his profile.“Three of our fellow students are being put on trial not because of evidence but because of a DA’s incompetence and malice,” he wrote in the university’s student paper. “Sadly, many in the community have shown that they are not fair minded but would rather hunt for witches than search for justice.”Miller’s writings were one of the main factors in Boyd hiring him.“I focused on his material he had written for the other two members of the House. I was very impressed he had a column in college and he was a very good writer,” Boyd recalled. “I was impressed with his intellect, I was impressed with his grasp of politics. I was impressed with his ability to get the core of the matter and articulate it in a way [the public would] understand.”Sessions’ office later found out that Miller had an uncanny ability to channel the senator’s when dealing with the press. Colleagues of Miller’s and Sessions’ told Politico that the two had a “mind meld,” a quality that Boyd also attested to.“Miller has demonstrated an ability to capture the voice of his boss in a way that is very important and also exceeds the ability of most Capitol Hill staff,” Boyd said.That voice was mostly flexed on immigration, where explained Sessions’ views to the public.When his boss was accused by pro-immigration groups of being a demagogue for his opposition to an unsuccessful 2010 bill to grant illegal immigrants amnesty for enrolling in college or enlisting in the military, Miller stuck to the issue instead of responding with another attack.“The DREAM Act is a proposal for mass amnesty that would even include those who have committed serious criminal offenses,” he told AL.com in November 2010. “It would add millions of newly authorized workers at a time when Americans are struggling with high unemployment and recession.”Besides being a conduit between the senator and the media, Miller also played a role on policy matters; he was instrumental in helping Sessions derail the Gang of Eight immigration reform bill in 2014 that would have given illegals a pathway to citizenship. Miller helped put together a briefing book for Republicans filled with talking points and data to bolster their case.”Boyd said Miller’s involvement on policy was unusual for a communications staffer.“It is rare, although in his case I think it speaks to his grasp on the issues and his understanding as they impact the average man and woman,” Boyd said. “There’s no doubt that there was a great trust between Sen. Sessions toward Stephen Miller and they made a great team.”Miller’s having switched to a high-level position on Trump’s team at a relatively young age does not come as a shock to Boyd, who said his former colleague has adeptly articulated Trump’s views.“I think personally that Miller was one of the first people to really understand the deep frustration that the American working class is feeling, their concerns with open borders and trade policies that hurt them more than they help, and also brought an ability to channel that energy toward president-elect Trump,” he said.  ",fake

A severe food crisis is part of the socialist utopia that just keeps going downhill. What’s next? Cannibalism?President Nicolas Maduro unveiled a government program called  “Plan Rabbit” at a meeting with his agriculture minister, Freddy Bernal, that was broadcast on Periscope, CNN Money reported. It’s a plan to distribute rabbits to communities across Venezuela to breed and eat. Maduro noted that rabbits breed quickly and are a good source of protein, but not cholesterol.GOVERNMENT PUSHES A “CHANGE IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS”“The rabbit isn’t a pet, it’s only two and a half kilos of meat,” Bernal stressed in the streamed announcement. He then invoked President Donald Trump to push the program.“Trump’s attack against the Venezuelan people is an opportunity to revise and change cultural consumption patterns,” he said.Venezuelan opposition leaders immediately slammed the move.“Are you serious?” asked former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles in a video response. “You want people to start raising rabbits to solve the problem of hunger in our country?”A 2016 study found that three-fourths of Venezuelans had lost almost twenty pounds on average over the course of the year. Meat is particularly scarce in the South American nation, with citizens even resorting to butchering zoo animals, according to police.Most economists agree the mass hunger is the result of socialist government policies spearheaded by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and Maduro, his successor. Chavez instituted price controls on many food items, which helped lead to shortages and massive inflation.We’ve previously reported on shortages of food and even toilet paper in Venezuela.BYOTP! NO TOILET PAPER AND NO FOODSocialism doesn’t work but I guess Venezuela didn’t get the memo. No toilet paper? No food? Yes, it’s come to that in this socialist hellhole…Venezuela’s product shortages have become so severe that some hotels in that country are asking guests to bring their own toilet paper and soap, a local tourism industry spokesman said on Wednesday….
“It’s an extreme situation,” says Xinia Camacho, owner of a 20-room boutique hotel in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada national park. “For over a year we haven’t had toilet paper, soap, any kind of milk, coffee or sugar. So we have to tell our guests to come prepared.”…
Montilla says bigger hotels can circumvent product shortages by buying toilet paper and other basic supplies from black market smugglers who charge up to 6-times the regular price. But smaller, family-run hotels can’t always afford to pay such steep prices, which means that sometimes they have to make do without.READ MORE: WFB ",fake

803,05-Aug-18,"Downtown Berkeley on Sunday became, once again, the site of a conflict between right-wing protesters and counterprotesters, crushing the hopes of city officials for a mellow day.For most of the afternoon, flocks of protesters surged along Berkeley’s central streets, defying police officers’ attempts to corral them. Meanwhile, in Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park, a small group of “anti-Marxists” sparred with those who came out to denounce them as white supremacists.The confrontation stemmed from an announcement earlier in the week from the Proud Boys and another right-wing group that they might stage a gathering Sunday at Civic Center Park, the site of previous clashes. –SF GateProtesters threw homemade fireworks at officers in the area of Milvia and Center streets, prompting police to deploy a smoke canister, White said. As of Sunday afternoon, police reported protesters also had vandalized more than 20 cars, all of which were Berkeley city vehicles — smashing their windows and setting one on fire — and burned three dumpsters.The city, under the authority of an emergency ordinance, passed earlier this week, prohibited protestors from bringing weapons, signs mounted on sticks or other potentially dangerous items into the area around the park. Masks also were prohibited. Even so, police confiscated dozens of items Sunday, including homemade fireworks; a sledgehammer with a rusty, metal head; wooden poles wrapped with black cloth; black helmets; shields; and pepper spray or mace.

805,05-Aug-18,"RUSH LIMBAUGH’S  EXPLANATION BELOW IS WHAT WE ALL KNOW BUT IS THE BEST WE’VE HEARD YET ON WHY THINGS HAPPENED THE WAY THEY DID WITH HILLARY AND WHY TRUMP IS GETTING BLASTED:Who DOESN’T listen to the Friday open-line portion on Rush Limbaugh? It’s great because Rush gets to give longer explanations on everything he believes is happening or has happened in the world of politics. He’s insightful and honest.The Friday show’s highlight was when a woman called in to discuss Hillary Clinton’s emails and speculation that Vladimir Putin was corresponding with Hillary. Rush began by discussing the fact that it’s hard for Americans to comprehend that our government would lie and not follow the rule of law so people make up conspiracy theories. He went on to give a lengthy answer but such a thoroughly honest assessment of what happened and is still happening to clear Hillary and destroy Trump. To understand why Hillary was protected and why we now have an attack on a sitting president, you need to realize that we DO have two systems of justice…RUSH LIMBAUGH: TWO SYSTEMS OF JUSTICEWe have two systems of justice in this country, and it’s become patently obvious to everybody.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Look, it’s going to sound very simplistic to say this. But this is simply what I’ve observed, and you have to have the courage to admit what you’re watching, and it’s very simple. If you are a Democrat and you’ve engaged in any kind of questionable, illegal activity, you get a pass. You get a pass if you’re not a Democrat. If you’re a Republican, you don’t. The entire thing that is happening — the Mueller investigation, the special counsel thing. Everything that’s happening here is the result of one thing.Everybody involved from Mueller to Comey to all these people at the FBI, to Rosenstein, to Barack Obama — who is in the thick of this because all of this happened, it all began in his administration. They all knew that Hillary Clinton had violated countless laws, and they knew that Obama had too by virtue of communicating with her in that illegal server. But the uranium deal is also another situation where she and her husband both profited in ways that are illegal, $500,000 for a speech to somebody in Moscow that Clinton got.THE URANIUM DEAL:The uranium deal, the Clintons’ foundation. The Clinton Foundation is the focus. The Clinton Foundation, if there were ever an investigation of that, is where the dominos to the Clintons would fall. All of this… The Steele dossier, the Russian collusion with Trump, the Manafort trial, everything that happened here was designed to exonerate and shift blame away from Hillary Clinton. She was going to be the Democrat nominee. They could not permit the Democrat Party nominee to come under the auspices of the law.THEY HAD TO EXONERATE HER:They had to exonerate her. They had to make sure she would never be prosecuted. They had to steer everybody’s attention away from the illegal activity that she, her campaign, and the Democrat National Committee, had all engaged in. Because if they had not done that then she would have been tainted, might not have survived as the party nominee, and everybody involved here had a personal stake, a career stake, a financial stake in Hillary Clinton becoming the next president.THEY WERE ALL GOING TO KEEP THEIR JOBS:They were all going to keep their jobs. They would be able to parlay those jobs into huge, private-sector jobs down the road. None of this that has happened would have happened. There wouldn’t have been any upset, there wouldn’t have been any disturbance in the force field of the deep state. But in order for Hillary Clinton to get elected, she had to be exonerated, protected and shielded from all the illegal activity she and her husband had engaged in.And people have seen this — average, ordinary Americans who normally would not know any of this because the Drive-By Media doesn’t report any of this the way I’ve explained it to you. I’m not the only one that’s explained it to you this way. Average, ordinary Americans plainly see that on the Democrat Party side of the aisle, the scales of justice are always balanced towards innocence and not being held accountable. On the Republican side, it’s the exact opposite.SHE HAD TO BE THE PARTY NOMINEE:Trump has not committed a single crime that he’s been alleged to. But Hillary did! They couldn’t let that go forward. She had to be exonerated. She had to be the party nominee. She was going to be the party nominee; she had to win the presidency. And this election constitutes one of the biggest, most gigantic political upsets in the history of this country, and the deep state still has not recovered from it. They are still discombobulated.PURSUIT OF TRUMP:So they are now embarking and continuing with this pursuit of Trump and anybody in his orbit as guilty of this or guilty of that to continue to now shield what they did in exonerating Hillary, in protecting Hillary, in not holding her accountable — and everybody that’s paying attention knows this. That’s why during a Trump rally if her name comes up the crowd chants, “Lock her up! Lock her up!” People know. There’s been too much reporting on it.TWO SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE:There’s been too many attempts to cover it up in the Drive-By Media. People know that we have two systems of justice in Washington and that the Democrats are not held accountable the same way Republicans are. We have two political systems of justice, and everybody’s fed up. So when people see this — when they see the rich and the powerful who they know are guilty as sin — not even be pursued and not even be prosecuted, they start conjuring up explanations.“There has to be some explanation. It can’t be…” They say to themselves, “It can’t be that our justice system has crumbled and that we have nobody worth their salt running it anymore. It can’t be that the criminal justice system in the United States — the Department of Justice, the FBI. They can’t all be totally corrupt,” people say. There has to be some other reason to explain this. That begets that conspiracy theory or this conspiracy theory, because people can’t explain it.But, my friends, you know the old adage, Occam’s razor: “The simplest and the most obvious explanation is probably the explanation.” I don’t think this is complicated at all. I think they had to make sure… Hillary Clinton is so corrupt and has been so touched by that corruption and bordering on illegality just with the foundation, with all those financial donations coming from people she didn’t know, from countries all over the world. They were not donating to charities.They were donating to future President Hillary Clinton. They were expecting something for all that money. She had to win. Plus, these people were talking about are all invested in the Clintons anyway. The Clintons have run the Democrat Party since the ’90s. They’ve got dossiers. You talk about dossiers? They’ve got dossiers on everybody. They have professed loyalty. That’s why the Obama circumstances in 2008 and coming along winning a nomination, threw the Democrat Party into more turmoil than you will ever believe.So when 2016 came around, it was Hillary and nobody else. Bernie Sanders never had a prayer. He was there as a foil. Everybody knew it except his voters. The fix was in for Hillary. We know it was — and the fix was in to the extent that she was going to be exonerated of any criminal activity, any corruption in advance. She wasn’t going to have to survive a trial. She wasn’t even going to be charged.Meanwhile, we see what’s happened on the Republican side, with all of the efforts to literally destroy people — including Donald Trump — who haven’t done anything close to that which they’ve been accused of. So people are naturally going to come up with the wildest conspiracy theories to explain this because they’re fed up with it and it just doesn’t make sense. How can our justice system…? This is the United States of America!We are not a Third World tinhorn dictatorship. How can this happen? Everybody trusts our justice system, for the most part. They trust the DOJ. What we’ve seen? Bill Clinton meets with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac. Hillary Clinton is exonerated before her interview with the FBI. The exoneration memo is written before. Hillary Clinton’s political aides are confirmed as lawyers so they have attorney-client privilege.They get to sit in with her on the interview. All of the laptops with all the evidence of what Hillary did are destroyed by the FBI agents that interviewed her. People see this and they say, “Gee whiz! I couldn’t get this. No Republican could get this. The fix is in.”",fake

809,04-Aug-18,"After the debut of the movie, Hollywood actresses and actors explained why “White Power” is racist, but “Black power” is a actually good thing. Ron Stallworth, the central figure depicted in the movie also discusses his disdain for President Trump at the premiere of Lee’s new movie:There's a big difference between white power and black power, so we asked the stars in attendance of Spike Lee's #BlacKkKlansman premiere to share their thoughts. pic.twitter.com/s3TUDh3mqS— The Root (@TheRoot) August 4, 2018According to the Hollywood Reporter, BlacKkKlansman tells the true story of Ron Stallworth (played by John David Washington), the African-American police officer who skillfully infiltrated a Colorado chapter of Ku Klux Klan in 1979, exposing their plan to attack people of color. According to producer Raymond Mansfield (Get Out), Lee “successfully walked a delicate line” by juxtaposing the discrimination against black people in the ’70s with the racist behavior exhibited by some Americans since Trump was elected into office.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“We knew it was tricky because if done wrong, it could feel exploitative. But we decided shortly after it happened to include that footage. It was Spike’s idea,” said Mansfield. “He wrote it into the screenplay and as soon as we saw the revised draft come through, all of us went, ‘That’s it.’ It ties the entire movie together in the most profound and emotionally effective way. We thought it was a stroke of genius.”Topher Grace, who plays KKK leader David Duke in BlacKkKlansman, agrees. “The film starts with a shot of the Civil War and it ends with Charlottesville. There’s only one filmmaker who can draw that line,” the actor told THR, emphasizing Duke and Trump’s “eerily similar” mannerisms. “A big part of my research going into playing Duke was watching old interviews. When I watched him on The Phil Donahue Show, he kept using the terms, ‘America first’ and ‘Make America great again.’ The parallels are insane.”The real-life Stallworth — who details his interaction with Duke and the KKK in his upcoming memoir, Black Klansman — also came out to support Lee on Monday night. The cop-turned-author said the director and writer “did a masterful job” of telling his story, while drawing comparisons between Trump’s “hateful” rhetoric and the bigotry that was prevalent 40 years ago.“The racism today is just like it was then. If anything, it’s even worse because Trump has basically allowed racists to come out of the shadows. We need to be vigilant to that and try to address it from a perspective like Spike’s,” Stallworth told THR. “Trump is an idiot, and his idiocy needs to be brought to the forefront. Spike did a masterful job at capturing that.”",fake

812,03-Aug-18,"Rasmussen just released a new poll, showing that support for President Trump with black Americans is up to 29%.Only 8% of black Americans said they supported his presidency prior to the 2016 election.Only 18 months into Trump’s presidency and black unemployment is already at a historic low. Black voters are starting to take notice of President Trump, as they’re beginning to see that he actually cares about giving them a chance to improve their communities, by helping them find more job opportunities, giving them tax cuts, and providing them with better education options.Whether he’s fighting to bring lost manufacturing jobs back to America or to keep illegal aliens from taking jobs from the black community because they’re willing to be paid less, or under the table, President Trump has made a commitment to give all able-bodied Americans the opportunity to live the American dream without having to rely on the Democrat Party who only offers handouts for votes.Yesterday, a group of black religious leaders came together for a meeting with President Trump, where they praised his leadership and commitment to the black community.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Phillip Goudeaux of Calvary Christian Center on Del Paso Boulevard was among more than a dozen black religious leaders who sat down with Trump on Wednesday at a meeting that the White House said was organized to share ideas about prison reform and criminal justice.At the event, the pastors widely praised Trump, with one participant calling him “the most pro-black president we’ve had in our lifetime,” according to a transcript of the meeting provided by the White House. Sacramento BeeToday, Chicago residents took to the streets to demand the resignation of Democrat Mayor, and longtime Obama friend and political crony, Rahm Emanuel.FOX News’ Gianno Caldwell took to the streets of Chicago to interview protestors.

814,02-Aug-18,"CNN’s Jim Acosta is sadly mistaken…The White House press briefings are not about him and whatever agenda he has for calling attention to himself. He continues to distract and try and disrupt briefings so HE can be the clip of the night. It’s become come obvious that he’s got a big problem. Watch the video below where Sarah Sanders just lets him have it…You will looove this!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBIPlWm87cQHe pranced over to CNN and spoke with Brook Baldwin after this embarrassing moment at the White House:What a whiner! CNN’s Jim Acosta ranted against President Trump’s “attacks” on the media today after he made a spectacle of himself by walking out of the White House briefing early. It’s so funny that he thinks he matters. He doesn’t.He also suggested that reporters chant on Pennsylvania Avenue “we’re not the enemy of the people” in protest against President Trump…Haha! The funny part of this comes at the end when Brooke Baldwin says, “Amen” to Acosta’s rant. Ridiculous!Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO] WFB reports:Acosta walked out of the briefing in protest, although he returned to tell CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin afterward it was a sad moment.“Sadly, Brooke, I think what you saw happen here at the end of that briefing was the true feelings of the president, the true feelings of many of the people that work in this administration laid bare,” Acosta said. “They believe … that the journalists who cover this White House, the journalists who work in this city, who were just trying a few moments ago to hold some of these officials accountable about attacks on our democracy, that the people here who work at this White House all the way up to the president evidently believe that journalists are the enemy of the people. Literally, the enemy of the people.”Except for Ivanka Trump, Baldwin noted.Acosta said he gave Sanders “several opportunities to set the record straight,” and she refused. Sanders noted she receives Secret Service protection because of threats she has received, and while he sympathized, Acosta said she and Trump continued to regularly tell lies and needed to be fact-checked.“I’ll say that the press is not the enemy of the people,” Acosta said. “And, you know, I think maybe we should make some bumper stickers, make some buttons, you know, maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant ‘CNN Sucks and ‘Fake News,’ maybe we should go out, all journalists, should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant, ‘We’re not the enemy of the people.'”“Because I’m tired of this,” he went on. “Honestly, Brooke, I’m tired of this. It is not right. It is not fair. It is not just. It is un-American to come out here and call the press the enemy of the people, and Ivanka Trump knows that. I don’t know why her father doesn’t, and I don’t know why this press secretary doesn’t. I mean, she got yelled at at a restaurant in Virginia. I’m sorry about that. I feel badly for her that happened. That comedian at the correspondent’s dinner said some unpleasant things about her. I’m sorry about that. She ought to hear some of the things that were said to me the other night in Tampa … It would be nice if we all lowered the temperature a little bit but at the very least, I think we should all be able to agree on one thing, and that is the press is not the enemy of the people. Fellow Americans are not the enemy of fellow Americans, and, you know, forgive me for going on a rant, but I think that they’ve lost sight of that here at this White House.”Baldwin said “Amen” to Acosta’s speech and appreciated “this is personal for you.”",fake

Don’t forget the thousands upon thousands of illegal alien minors who flooded the border during Obama’s presidency. The bottom line is that open borders have consequences and the unfortunate consequence for taxpayers is we’re footing the bill for illegals and THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE!The swelling population of illegal immigrants and their kids is costing American taxpayers $135 billion a year, the highest ever, driven by free medical care, education and a huge law enforcement bill, according to the the most authoritative report on the issue yet.DON’T FORGET THAT OBAMA HELPED FACILITATE THE ARRIVAL OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL MINORS THAT WE ARE NOW PAYING FOR:
Spanish-language media and human rights activists are actively educating illegal immigrants on how to break the law, avoid immigration agents and remain in the country even after a judge has ordered them to be kicked out, a top Obama administration official testified to Congress on Tuesday.HERE’S THOMAS HOMAN’S TESTIMONY FROM 2014:
Despite claims from pro-illegal immigration advocates that the aliens pay significant off-setting taxes back to federal, state and local treasuries, the Federation for American Immigration Reform report tallied just $19 billion, making the final hit to taxpayers about $116 billion.
State and local governments are getting ravaged by the costs, at over $88 billion. The federal government, by comparison, is getting off easy at $45 billion in costs for illegals.n.The report, titled “The Fiscal Burden Of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers,” is the most comprehensive cost tally from FAIR. It said that the costs have jumped about $3 billion in four years and will continue to surge unless illegal immigration is stopped. It was provided in advance exclusively to Secrets.“Clearly, the cost of doing nothing to stop illegal immigration is far too high,” said FAIR Executive Director Dan Stein. “President Trump has laid out a comprehensive strategy to regain control of illegal immigration and bring down these costs,” said Stein. “Building the wall, enhancing interior enforcement and mandating national E-Verify will go a long way in bringing these ridiculously high costs under control,” he added.Over 68 often shocking pages, FAIR documents the average $8,075 in state, local and federal spending for each of the of 12.5 million illegal immigrants and their 4.2 million citizen children.Broadly, the costs include $29 billion in medical care, $23 billion for law enforcement, $9 billion in welfare, $46 billion for education.Just consider the cost of teaching an illegal alien child who doesn’t speak English. FAIR estimates an average cost of over $12,000 a year, and that can reach $25,000 in New York. Add to that welfare, health care, school lunches, and the per student price soars.In state costs alone, California leads the list at $23 billion per year, followed by Texas at $11 billion, and New York at $7.4 billion.And it also documents the taxes paid and how they don’t come close to offsetting the costs. What’s more, FAIR noted that 35 percent of the illegal population operate in an underground economy hidden from tax collectors. And worse, employers hire illegals and either pay them cheaply or under the table.“The United States recoups only about 14 percent of the amount expended annually on illegal aliens. If the same jobs held by illegal aliens were filled by legal workers, at the prevailing market wage, it may safely be presumed that federal, state and local governments would receive higher tax payments,” said FAIR.Key findings pulled from the report are shocking:The staggering total costs of illegal immigrants and their children outweigh the taxes paid to federal and state governments by a ratio of roughly 7 to 1, with costs at nearly $135 billion compared to tax revenues at nearly $19 billion.The nearly $135 billion paid out by federal and state and local taxpayers to cover the cost of the presence of 12.5 million illegal aliens and their 4.2 million citizen children amounts to approximately $8,075 per illegal alien and citizen child prior to taxes paid, or $6,940 per person after taxes are paid.On the federal level, medical ($17.14 billion) is by far the highest cost, with law enforcement coming second ($13.15 billion) and general government services ($8 billion) third.At the state and local level, education ($44.4 billion) was by far the largest expense, followed by general public services ($18.5 billion) and medical ($12.1 billion).The top three states based on total cost to state taxpayers for illegal immigrants and their children: California ($23 billion); Texas ($10.9 billion), and New York ($7.5 billion).Read more: WE ",fake

The Bronze Star he earned stayed in his dresser drawer.A few years after Edward Pence died, a cousin who’d grown up with him told the vice president that the war had changed him from being “the most happy-go-lucky guy” he’d ever met.“Then he said words I’ll never forget,” Pence said Saturday at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, where he laid a wreath for Veterans Day. “He said, and I quote: ‘I don’t think your dad ever got over the guilt of coming home. I don’t think your dad ever got over the guilt of coming home.’”The remains of over 50 American soldiers killed in the Korean War will soon be headed to Hawaii after a United States military plane successfully retrieved the remains on Thursday.According to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, the U.S. plane left from the Osan Air base in South Korea on Thursday morning, and U.S. military officials confirmed that the remains were successfully transferred to an American base in South Korea later in the day.The White House also confirmed Friday that Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Hawaii on Aug. 1 to participate in the Honorable Carry Ceremony and receive the remains as they return to American soil.“As the son of a Korean War combat veteran, it is deeply humbling to be part of this historic moment,” Pence said, in a statement.The transfer of about 55 sets of remains from the 1950-1953 Korean War was part of an agreement reached at President Donald Trump’s summit with Kim Jong Un in Singapore last month. Several thousand American military members and their families were there to greet the plane as it landed at the Osan Air Base in South Korea. –Hawaii News NowTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Trump recently thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a tweet:The Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States!

But it’s going to be meaningful to every veteran and frankly, every family who I think sees President Trump’s heart in this moment.”Bartiromo asked Vice President Pence about the details of the remains of our troops being sent back to the US, “Why did Kim Jong Un agree to it?”Pence responded with what seemed to be a logical answer, “Because President Trump asked him.”Pence went on to explain how proud he was to be part of this historical event. ” That’s so moving to me.

He is also hoping to align himself with the Socialist-Democrat movement, as the Democrat Party’s socialist candidate for US Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joins Abdulrahman Mohamed El Sayed on the campaign trail.Since 2016, there has been a 650% increase in the number of Muslims running for office in America. From school board to Congress since the start of the election cycle, the AP is reporting, that while only about 50 candidates remain since the recent primaries, the number is still higher than it has been since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.El Sayed frequently bashes President Trump, who is bringing back the manufacturing jobs to the unemployed blue-collar workers in Michigan who never dreamed their jobs would return.Democrat politicians ignored the massive unemployment numbers in Michigan for decades, as workers watched their jobs and livelihoods go overseas. Meanwhile, Democrat Party politicians sat on their hands, as they were satisfied to keep the former blue-collar workers unemployed and beholden to the Democrat Party for their government-funded existence. The Democrats essentially traded their ability to achieve the American dream for votes, and nobody seemed to care.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Here are two examples of El-Sayed bashing President Trump on Twitter:Dear world, I’m sorry for @realdonaldtrump.

El Sayed claims he is “honored” to receive her support for his candidacy. Does anyone else hear alarm bells?Linda Sarsour – #JusticeOrElse Speech""We are one sister's and brother's and our liberation is bound up together. The same people who justify the massacres of Palestinian people and call it collateral damage are the same people who justify the murder of young Black men and women. The same people who want to deport millions of undocumented immigrants are the same people hate Muslims and want to take our right to worship freely in this country. That common enemy sisters and brothers is #WhiteSupremacy, let's call it what it is."" – Linda Sarsour at the #JusticeOrElse march on the 20th anniversary of the Million Man MarchPosted by Ummah Wide on Saturday, October 10, 2015During a “see something, say something” forum with retired Homeland Security Officer Philip Haney, on April 2018, the second-term state senator from Canton Township talked about a “civilization jihad” plot by Muslims to “change our system of government” in America by implementing Sharia law. The effort includes obtaining “positions of influence,” he said, noting Hamtramck now has the first Muslim-majority City Council in the country.“But we also have somebody I will also likely be running against in the general election, Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, whose parents apparently have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood back in Egypt,” Colbeck said in one clip. “This is scary stuff.”Colbeck clarified his remarks by saying, “I’m not casting aspersions on all Muslims, just those affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.”The response from Michigan’s Democrat candidate, Abdulrahman Mohamed El Sayed to Patrick Colbeck’s remarks has been ignored by the media. Instead of addressing Colbeck’s claims, El Sayed spewed a blanket claim that all Muslims hate Colbeck, not just El Sayed, but ALL Muslims.We’re pretty sure that if Colbeck told El Sayed that ALL Christians hated him, his career as a politician would have abruptly ended, yet, with the exception of a blurb in the Detroit News, this is likely the first time you’re reading about the claim El-Sayed made in front of a room full of people, including journalists, on behalf of every Muslim in Michigan (or perhaps the world?)Detroit News – Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed on Thursday called for Republican rivals to condemn “Islamophobia” and “racism” after comments by GOP hopeful Patrick Colbeck during a rare forum featuring all seven candidates from the two major parties.El-Sayed is a practicing Muslim who has previously denied any affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood but on Thursday refused to dignify Colbeck’s comments, even after calling on Republican candidates Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, Attorney General Bill Schuette and Dr. Jim Hines to disavow them.In July 2018, El Sayed bragged about the endorsement of Sharia advocate, and promoter of hate-preacher, and open Jew-hater, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakahn.Instead of responding directly to Colbeck and his claims about Sharia religious law creeping into the United States, El-Sayed noted that he or any candidate elected governor will have to take an oath to swear and uphold the state and federal constitutions.It “guarantees me the right to pray as I choose to pray” and says that “no religious test shall be held over someone aiming to serve under this constitution,” El-Sayed said. “That is an incredible document.”Colbeck denied that his repeated warnings of “civilization jihad” are rooted in racism or white supremacism.“I love Muslims. It’s not an issue. The issue is terrorist organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood,” he said.None of the other Republican candidates for governor addressed Colbeck’s comments during the forum. But Calley said after the event that he does “not agree with what Sen. Colbeck said.”Colbeck made similar comments in a video that surfaced last month and was posted online by The United West of Florida, which has been called an anti-Muslim hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.So, who is Abdulrahman Mohamed El Sayed and how did he become a candidate for governor in the state of Michigan with no previous political appointments? Why is he frequently compared to Barack Obama? Jen Kuznicki, an actual journalist who lives in northern Michigan published a lengthy investigation into the background El Sayed, the Democrat candidate for governor.

We need it! Get smart! With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2018From The Hill: To understand, it helps to begin with the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when U.S. intel agencies sought to expand their surveillance authority — for what seemed like all the right reasons. (For context, a week before 9/11, Robert Mueller had become FBI director; a month earlier, James Clapper had been named head of the agency that supplies image intel to the CIA, and John Brennan recently had become CIA deputy executive director.)Wiretapping foreigners who could be terrorists isn’t as sensitive an issue, since our law doesn’t give them the same protection as U.S. citizens. The problem comes when wiretaps include U.S. citizens in contact with foreign targets. That’s called “incidental” collection.And it’s not just phone calls. Today’s wiretaps can include everything on the web — emails, bank accounts, photos, messaging, Facebook posts. And “incidental collection” can include anything picked up when a target is watched directly, through a bug, or by secretly activating his computer’s microphone and camera.U.S. citizens who aren’t accused of crimes are entitled to strong constitutional privacy protections. So, to alleviate worries that citizens’ rights might be violated through “incidental” spying on foreign targets, the intel agencies adopted strict rules. At first, they promised to destroy any “incidental” intelligence they collected. Later, they decided to store it — for a short time — but promised that the names of the U.S. citizens would be “masked,” or hidden, even internally.Then, they argued that they needed to store the information on U.S. citizens a little longer, and might occasionally need to “unmask” or reveal their names. Still, “unmasking” was supposed to be extraordinarily rare, requiring a high-ranking official’s approval accompanied by a strong legal argument that the citizen’s name is crucial to addressing some national-security threat.But several years ago, intel insiders tell me, the process was corrupted. Here’s how:An official who is a bad actor may want to monitor a U.S. citizen — say, a political enemy or a journalist — but knows he could never get wiretap approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). So he develops a pretext to wiretap a foreigner or a target in contact with that citizen. He then “incidentally” captures the citizen’s information, too. Later, he builds a case for “unmasking” the U.S. citizen’s name, supposedly for national security or other crucial reasons.Here’s the best part — for the bad actors. The U.S. citizens are usually none the wiser. The surveillance isn’t intended to build a criminal case; it’s to collect dirt or political intel or blackmail material. So the corrupt process is never scrutinized in a U.S. court.Think of it as reverse engineering of intel.In 2016, very real questions were raised about whether reverse engineering of intel was widely deployed in an unethical manner. A red flag waved when we got a sense of how many Americans are “incidentally” surveilled — so many, that near-daily unmasking requests were said to be made in 2016 under the name of a single official: United Nations AmbassadorWho else was involved? Then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates, national security adviser Susan Rice, and Director of National Intelligence Clapper. Clapper said he requested unmasking of American names “every couple of weeks.”Apparently, it became so common that Clapper told Congress he probably made some requests on his way out the door before Trump’s inauguration, but couldn’t recall the specifics.Watch James Clapper and Sally Yates discuss the unmasking of Trump officials or members of Congress with Judiciary Committee Chair, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).Barack Obama’s former National Security Adviser Susan Rice refused an invitaation from the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify alongside James Clapper and Sally Yates.One final note: Last October, Amb. Power reportedly told congressional investigators that many of the hundreds of “unmasking” requests in her name in 2016 were not made by her. If true, it implies something equally problematic, or worse: Someone else in the government used her name to unmask Americans.The good news would seem to be that there’s documentary evidence of all this … if anyone wants to discover it. There are names of who requested what and when, information as to where unmasked intel was sent, names of those who searched the NSA database and under what auspices. Unlike a lot of facets of the Trump-Russia-intel controversy, this trail should be easily traceable.But we just might be too busy chasing the pretty colors flashing before us every day. They might be keeping us from taking a good hard look at a very serious matter.Officials involved in unmaskings insist they did nothing improper, that their motivations were to protect the nation. They say they did not act for political reasons, or to spy.If they did, people could go to prison. Theoretically.",fake

Gaetz argued earlier this week that he believes that Twitter may have illegally donated to the campaigns of his opponents by prejudicing against his content and limiting his social media visibility. An investigation from the far-left Vice Magazine found that only conservatives users were being subjected to the Twitter search limiting that impacted Gaetz.The tech company has denied that they are shadowbanning conservatives while admitting to limiting the visibility of certain accounts. In May, the company began using “behavior-based signals” to determine which accounts should be limited and which ones should be boosted “to improve the health of the public conversation on Twitter.” – The Gateway PunditRep. Matt Gaetz appeared on the Tucker Carlson show tonight to explain why he filed a complaint against Twitter with the FEC.“My suspicion is that if people were effectively communicating a conservative message, they got caught in Twitter’s toll-trap. The reason that I think that is illegal is because that it gives advantages to our political opponents. It gives them access to a platform that we don’t have. If Twitter was a billboard company and they gave Democrats access to their billboards and not Republicans, that would be an illegal corporate donation to campaigns of Democrats.” Tucker asked if Gaetz believes the FEC can remedy this? Gaetz explained that Twitter said in their official response that it was his behavior that caused them to limit his visibility. Gaetz asked, “Are we really going to trust tech companies to be able to just decide with no transparency, what behavior limits someone’s ability to amplify their message?”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Tucker reminded Congressman Gaetz and his viewers that Twitter is actually a small player in the world of tech censorship.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2018Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Harvard law professor and liberal, Alan Dershowitz voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. In a weird twist, the brilliant attorney, Alan Dershowitz has become one of the loudest voices in America in the defense of President Trump, as it relates to Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian collusion with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election.While Dershowitz admits he doesn’t support President Trump or his policies, he is so adamant about his case against impeaching President Trump, that he’s written a book to lay out his case called, “The Case Against Impeaching Trump”.In his book, Dershowitz argues that if even if incriminating evidence emerged of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it still wouldn’t be considered a criminal offense because it’s “not a crime to collude with a foreign government.”Watch, as Dershowitz lays out his case against impeaching President Trump to a rabid group of liberals on MSNBC:“The Case Against Impeaching Trump” is available for purchase on Amazon and most major book outlets.From the book:  “Maybe the question isn’t what happened to Alan Dershowitz. Maybe it’s what happened to everyone else.”—Politico Alan Dershowitz has been called “one of the most prominent and consistent defenders of civil liberties in America” by Politico and “the nation’s most peripatetic civil liberties lawyer and one of its most distinguished defenders of individual rights” by Newsweek. Yet he has come under partisan fire for applying those same principles to Donald Trump during the course of his many appearances in national media outlets as an expert resource on civil and constitutional law. The Case Against Impeaching Trump seeks to reorient the debate over impeachment to the same standard that Dershowitz has continued to uphold for decades: the law of the United States of America, as established by the Constitution. In the author’s own words: “In the fervor to impeach President Trump, his political enemies have ignored the text of the Constitution. As a civil libertarian who voted against Trump, I remind those who would impeach him not to run roughshod over a document that has protected us all for two and a quarter centuries. In this case against impeachment, I make arguments similar to those I made against the impeachment of President Bill Clinton (and that I would be making had Hillary Clinton been elected and Republicans were seeking to impeach her). Impeachment and removal of a president are not entirely political decisions by Congress. Every member takes an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution sets out specific substantive criteria that MUST be met. I am thrilled to contribute to this important debate and especially that my book will be so quickly available to readers so they can make up their own minds.”",fake

In fact, just 21% of Americans believe that these illegal aliens and their offspring should be released into American streets.According to a CBS poll, 48% of Americans says that the United States government should “release the entire family back to their home country together.” 11% of Americans believe that the parents should be arrested, but have their children kept with them in the same facility.Does United Airlines want to be seen as the airline who sides with these people?On another note, if you’re a member of the US military, United Airlines will allow you to check an extra bag for free:",fake

841,26-Jul-18,"Two Republican Congressman have filed charges of impeachment on the DOJ’s Rod Rosenstein. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan joined Laura Ingraham to explain their move: “Really for nine months, we’ve asked for documents. And that’s all we want, are the documents. What we’ve found is not only have subpoenas been ignored, but information has been hidden. The efforts have been stonewalled. I guess for us, it’s all about transparency so the American people can judge for themselves. So they may be able to ignore Congress, but they can’t ignore the American people.”Meadows and Jordan explained how the DOJ is stonewalling the release of information pertaining to their investigation to get to the bottom of the Trump dossier investigation.Jordan: “We’ve caught the Department of Justice hiding information, redacting information that they should not have redacted. We know that Rod Rosenstein threatened House Committee Intel staffers, threatened them, chilling impact, when they were trying to do their job, our job of getting, doing the Constitutional oversight we’re supposed to do.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Jordan says he ‘s tired of the Justice Department “giving them the finger”.  They want information they’ve subpoenaed the DOJ for but have not gotten.Jordan had the best comment when Ingraham made the point that it had been 122 years since someone in the Executive Branch and been impeached:“…when was the last time you ever saw the FBI take a disproven document with no credibility, no validity, no corroboration…  take it to a secret court, not tell the court who paid for it, not tell the court that the guy who wrote had been leaking information to the press. When have you ever…and not just once, four stinking times! The last one, Rod Rosenstein signed. So, if that’s not enough to force the action as Gregg talked about, contempt of impeachment, you tell me what is. Tell me what is.”“Look, we have been this patient — we started this a year ago in July asking for documents.

RefuseFascism.org’s website directs you to Alliance for Global Justice when you try to donate to the cause. The Alliance for Global Justice is connected to George Soros. He is behind much of the attempt to destroy Trump:CAPITAL RESEARCH REPORTS:Alliance for Global Justice (AfGJ). This Tucson, Arizona-based group had largely flown under the radar since its 1998 founding.  Yet in February 2017, AfGJ gained notoriety when the Daily Caller revealed that it had funneled $50,000 to Refuse Fascism, the group that was behind the riotous shutdown of a speech that conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to give at the University of California, Berkeley.AfGJ bills itself as “A little bit people’s think tank, a whole lot of organizing.” Indeed, everyone on AfGJ’s staff has considerable experience in organizing, both at home and abroad. But AfGJ does more than just organize. It helps fund many different left-wing groups through a legal maneuver known as “fiscal sponsorship.” And, as explained below, in a nation that is as polarized and has as many discontented young people as today’s America does, an organization like AfGJ can prove dangerous.According to its most recent (2015) IRS filing, AfGJ had just under $2.3 million in revenue, $2.1 million in expenses, and $753,909 in assets.AfGJ’s funding reads like a Who’s Who of radical left-wing foundations. Since 2004, AfGJ has received over $200,000 in funding from the Tides Foundation (Tides has received $3 million from Soros). Indeed, when other left-wing foundations want to give money to radical leftist groups but don’t want to be seen giving it directly, they donate to Tides as a pass-through. From 2004 to 2006, the Open Society Institute (now known as Open Society Foundations) gave $100,000 to AfGJ. The Open Society Institute was founded by billionaire George Soros, who seems never to have met a leftist cause he didn’t want to fund.What’s most disturbing about this is that our main stream media would be all over this if it was a conservative organization. Have you ever heard anything about this? The bottom line is that this should be horrifying to all Americans because one man is pushing for a revolution in America to force us into communism. Soros is connected to Obama in a big way too! ",fake

It would also wipe his $13.7 billion of gains for the year, leaving him with just less than $70 billion. –BloombergTrending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Entertainment Weekly reported that Facebook executives promoting their video-on-demand service got into a combative exchange with reporters while at the Television Critics Association’s press tour in Beverly Hills on Wednesday.Entertainment Weekly framed the argument as a fight to eliminate “right-wing conspiracy sites” like Fox News and Infowars.Without identifying the reporters, Entertainment Weekly explained how the conversation went down between Facebook executives and reporters who clearly had an issue with Facebook ALLOWING news organizations that didn’t push a liberal narrative to appear in the newsfeed.The kerfuffle started when Fidji Simo, Facebook’s vice president of video, was asked about Infowars stories on their platform while touting new Facebook Watch entertainment shows.“To be totally transparent, I find Infowars to be absolutely atrocious,” Simo replied. “But we have the job of balancing freedom of expression and safety. So the way we navigate that is, there’s a pretty big difference between what is allowed on Facebook and what gets distribution. What we’re trying to do is make it so that if you’re saying something that’s untrue on Facebook — which you’re allowed to say as long as you’re an authentic person and you adhere to community standards — but we’re trying to make it so it doesn’t get that much distribution.… We don’t always get it right, it’s very complicated, but that’s our principle.”Reporter: How do you limit distribution?“When we have something that a fact checker has told is not true or a lot of our audience is telling us is not true, we limit distribution. We tell our algorithms that this is not something we want to see distributed widely. That’s one way. Another way is the way misinformation spreads is by people sharing the content.… We pop up a module that says, ‘Our fact checker says is inaccurate, you might not want to do that.’ That decreases distribution by 80 percent, it’s very effective at reducing the spread of it.”Reporter: One of the most prominent organizations you’re working with is Fox News, and they’re sort of incorrigible about proliferating a lot of misinformation. Can you speak to your reasoning behind that? Why would you want to work with an organization like that when, as you said, you’re trying to limit the spread of false information?At this, Rick Van Even, head of global creative strategy at Facebook, jumped in: “Yeah, well, we have limited time, I’d like to keep it — Fidji doesn’t lead the news organization, Campbell Brown leads that…”Another reporter in the background: Answer the question!“We have limited time —”Another reporter: We’ll give you time! Simo: “We have a range of new shows we’re presenting —”Reporter: But Fox News is still on every day, including the weekends. They’re still on this programming list.Simo: “So is CNN —”According to Reuters, Facebook’s plummeting stock price wiped out about $150 billion in market capitalization in under two hours.The company had cautioned investors to expect a big jump in costs because of efforts to address concerns about poor handling of users’ privacy and to better monitor what users post.

331 Hart Senate Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20510
Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein:We are former students of Judge Kavanaugh’s from Harvard Law School, where he has been teaching since 2008. Over the years, Judge Kavanaugh has taught law school classes on challenging topics, including Separation of Powers and an intensive study of the modern Supreme Court. We are members of the legal community at various stages of our careers, from current law students to seasoned practitioners. We also represent a broad spectrum of political and ideological beliefs, as well as perspectives on judicial philosophy. We may have differing views on political issues surrounding the confirmation process, but we all agree on one thing: Judge Kavanaugh is a rigorous thinker, a devoted teacher, and a gracious person.Judge Kavanaugh was an inspiring professor and impressive intellect. His thoughtful explanations and analyses spoke to the breadth of his legal knowledge. He was also engaging and fair-minded. During classroom discussions, he displayed a keen interest in exploring all sides of a question. Judge Kavanaugh invited robust discussions and consistently encouraged his students to voice different viewpoints—even if others (or the judge himself) might disagree.Both inside and outside the classroom, Judge Kavanaugh evinced a genuine warmth and interest in his students and their careers. He was exceptionally generous with his time, making himself available to meet with students not only to discuss the class, but also to assist with their scholarly writing or to offer career advice. In many instances, he has continued to provide advice and support long after the class ended by writing letters of recommendation and serving as a valued mentor. In our view, his genuine interest in helping young lawyers demonstrates a deep commitment to the legal community as a whole.Overall, Judge Kavanaugh displayed an intellect and character that impressed us all.

When Cohen tells Trump, “We’ll have to pay.” Trump is heard saying “pay with cash” but the audio is muddled and it’s unclear whether he suggests paying with cash or not paying. Cohen says, “no, no” but it is not clear what is said next. What’s most shocking is the client/lawyer private discussion’s release to CNN. Something is just not ok with that but Lanny Davis said he wanted to refute the Trump claim that he wanted to pay for the story with a check. The recording is muffled and it’s unclear what is being said.Does anyone care about this? Have Americans had enough? This was when President Trump was a private citizen and was not in the Oval Office with an intern. We’d like to know what you think about this news.  ",fake
850,24-Jul-18,"Meghan McCain got into a heated debate about socialism on “The View” Tuesday.WFB – Whoopi Goldberg opened the discussion by discussing New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D.) and wondering “if anybody’s discussed the difference between socialism and democratic– I don’t know.”“Isn’t it more like– Isn’t democratic socialism very close to liberalism?” Behar asked. “I mean think about it for a second. Medicare, Social Security, garbage collection, the post office, the libraries, the fire department. That’s all democratic socialism.”Co-host Sonny Hostin appeared to be fully in favor of Ocasio-Cortez’s Socialist platform and even went on to passionately defend it when Megan McCain lit into the pack of dingbats, reminding them of the famous Margaret Thatcher quote about “running out of other people’s money”. Megan McCain used the US Post office and the VA as examples of how the government should not be in the business of running businesses. The View liberals, however, continued to argue their points about how socialism could be good for America.Megan McCain blasted her co-hosts: “Every democratic socialist who is going on TV saying that it’s good needs to start paying 90 percent in taxes. On your tax form, I think you should start paying the amount of taxes that every socialist in this country thinks you need to, because if you think the government’s so good at spending money, look at the VA.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Watch:After her stunning primary win in a very liberal Bronx district, the liberal “The View” hags interviewed Socialist-Democrat candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. When asked how she defeated the 10-term Democrat Congressman, Joe Crowley, Ocasio-Cortez explained her strategy, “I’m gonna work as hard as I can and just leave it up to…[pause] the universe.” This is the place where most Republicans would say they were leaving it up to God. Notice, how the 28-year-old Socialist conveniently appears to have replaced the word “God” with “universe”.Watch as the community organizer turned Socialist candidate for US Congress, explains to “The View” hosts about how she had no plan for winning the election against 10-term Congressional incumbent Joe Crowley, who has held the seat in the district she won for over 20 years, and about her presidential ambitions.What is it with these privileged Socialist-Democrats like Senator Bernie (3 homes in Vermont) Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the self-described Socialist-Democrat candidate for US Congress? Why are they so anxious to cry about the injustices of the poor, while living very comfortable lives, thanks to the benefits of capitalism? While Ocasio-Cortez’s biography tells the story of a poor little girl who grew up in the Bronx and drove 40 minutes from her home to attend better schools, her actual upbringing was much different.  Alexandria actually grew up in an upscale neighborhood, in a home that recently sold for a cool $355,000.",fake

Could they feel threatened by Trump? Video below from the Aspen Institute event from July of last year is full of rhetoric slamming Trump. It’s interesting to hear the two former intel leaders try and make a sitting president out to be something he clearly isn’t. In doing so, they expose themselves as complicit with the Deep State trying to destroy Trump. DiGenova called this entire “set-up” a “soft coup”…He couldn’t be more right!Joe DiGenova: It was abundantly clear that there was no legitimate basis even for a counter intelligence investigation, let alone a criminal investigation. It is quite obvious that John Brennan was at the head of the group of people who were going to create a counter intelligence investigation against Trump by creating false information that was going to be fed through Carter Page and fed through George Papadopoulos so that it would be picked up, reported back to Washington and provide the basis for a counter, a fake, counter intelligence investigation and it was all Brennan’s doing. And that is why the Justice Department is viciously fighting, revealing everything they can about the source in London who everybody knows the identity of.Laura Ingraham: Explain the source in London.Joe DiGenova: The source in London was another person who was feeding false information to George Papadopoulos and others about collusion which did not exist.PAUL SPERRY GOES INTO DETAIL ABOUT LYING BRENNAN:Former CIA Director John Brennan’s insistence that the salacious and unverified Steele dossier was not part of the official Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election is being contradicted by two top former officials.Recently retired National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers stated in a classified letter to Congress that the Clinton campaign-funded memos did factor into the ICA. And James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence under President Obama, conceded in a recent CNN interview that the assessment was based on “some of the substantive content of the dossier.” Without elaborating, he maintained that “we were able to corroborate” certain allegations.These accounts are at odds with Brennan’s May 2017 testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that the Steele dossier  was not in any way used as the basis for the intelligence community’s assessment” that Russia interfered in the election to help elect Donald Trump. Brennan has repeated this claim numerous times, including in February on “Meet the Press.”LISTEN TO THE VITRIOL AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE ASPEN INSTITUTE EVENT WHERE BRENNAN AND CLAPPER REVEALED HOW THREATENED THEY FELT:“The intelligence community will continue to convey truth to power even if power doesn’t necessarily listen.” The entire video is disturbing but eye opening. THEY FEEL THREATENED and this is clearly an effort to hurt President Trump.

How ironic is it that two men who lied under oath are speaking “truth” to power…FYI: John Brennan literally voted for the Communist party in the 1970s during the height of the Cold War…now they’re lecturing us about Russia.These two men define the deep state…This talk was really all about creating doubt on Trump and to defend themselves post Obama.

The FBI did not tell Congress about Mr. Steele’s connection to the Clinton campaign, and the House had to issue subpoenas for Fusion bank records to discover the truth. Nor did the FBI tell investigators that it continued receiving information from Mr. Steele and Fusion even after it had terminated him. The memo says the bureau’s intermediary was Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, whose wife, incredibly, worked for Fusion.And finally…16. Much of the “salacious and unverified” material in the dossier came from the Russians. In other words, those disgusting dossier lies about Trump’s personal behavior came from Russian operatives.

Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein:We are former students of Judge Kavanaugh’s from Harvard Law School, where he has been teaching since 2008. Over the years, Judge Kavanaugh has taught law school classes on challenging topics, including Separation of Powers and an intensive study of the modern Supreme Court. We are members of the legal community at various stages of our careers, from current law students to seasoned practitioners. We also represent a broad spectrum of political and ideological beliefs, as well as perspectives on judicial philosophy. We may have differing views on political issues surrounding the confirmation process, but we all agree on one thing: Judge Kavanaugh is a rigorous thinker, a devoted teacher, and a gracious person.Judge Kavanaugh was an inspiring professor and impressive intellect. His thoughtful explanations and analyses spoke to the breadth of his legal knowledge. He was also engaging and fair-minded. During classroom discussions, he displayed a keen interest in exploring all sides of a question. Judge Kavanaugh invited robust discussions and consistently encouraged his students to voice different viewpoints—even if others (or the judge himself) might disagree.Both inside and outside the classroom, Judge Kavanaugh evinced a genuine warmth and interest in his students and their careers. He was exceptionally generous with his time, making himself available to meet with students not only to discuss the class, but also to assist with their scholarly writing or to offer career advice. In many instances, he has continued to provide advice and support long after the class ended by writing letters of recommendation and serving as a valued mentor. In our view, his genuine interest in helping young lawyers demonstrates a deep commitment to the legal community as a whole.Overall, Judge Kavanaugh displayed an intellect and character that impressed us all.

Adam Schiff (D., Calif.).A statement from Icon executives made it clear the company considers Kavanaugh a threat to liberty in the United States.“It’s unclear how long SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearing will last, but we know that it is absolutely critical for our Senators to do everything possible to prevent the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice who would roll back women’s rights and undermine women’s health,” said Kejal Macdonald, Icon’s vice president of marketing.",fake

Keep it up Democrats!WHO IS REFUSE FASCISM?We looked into the anti-Trump/Pence signs being carried by protesters (PHOTO ABOVE). RefuseFascism.org’s website directs you to Alliance for Global Justice when you try to donate to the cause. The Alliance for Global Justice is connected to George Soros. He is behind much of the attempt to destroy Trump:CAPITAL RESEARCH REPORTS:Alliance for Global Justice (AfGJ). This Tucson, Arizona-based group had largely flown under the radar since its 1998 founding.  Yet in February 2017, AfGJ gained notoriety when the Daily Caller revealed that it had funneled $50,000 to Refuse Fascism, the group that was behind the riotous shutdown of a speech that conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to give at the University of California, Berkeley.AfGJ bills itself as “A little bit people’s think tank, a whole lot of organizing.” Indeed, everyone on AfGJ’s staff has considerable experience in organizing, both at home and abroad. But AfGJ does more than just organize. It helps fund many different left-wing groups through a legal maneuver known as “fiscal sponsorship.” And, as explained below, in a nation that is as polarized and has as many discontented young people as today’s America does, an organization like AfGJ can prove dangerous.According to its most recent (2015) IRS filing, AfGJ had just under $2.3 million in revenue, $2.1 million in expenses, and $753,909 in assets.AfGJ’s funding reads like a Who’s Who of radical left-wing foundations. Since 2004, AfGJ has received over $200,000 in funding from the Tides Foundation (Tides has received $3 million from Soros). Indeed, when other left-wing foundations want to give money to radical leftist groups but don’t want to be seen giving it directly, they donate to Tides as a pass-through. From 2004 to 2006, the Open Society Institute (now known as Open Society Foundations) gave $100,000 to AfGJ. The Open Society Institute was founded by billionaire George Soros, who seems never to have met a leftist cause he didn’t want to fund.What’s most disturbing about this is that our main stream media would be all over this if it was a conservative organization. Have you ever heard anything about this? The bottom line is that this should be horrifying to all Americans because one man is pushing for a revolution in America to force us into communism. Soros is connected to Obama in a big way too! ",fake

In an interview with Rabbi Michael Lerner, Keith Ellison declared that national borders are “an injustice”:This seems to be the trend with Democrats on the far left. Many have been more vocal about their desire for open borders. Here’s a little of what Ellison said that should make it clear we all need to vote Republican in November:“We just have to say that the 12 million undocumented people in the United States are here because somebody wants them to be. But they want them here to do the work, but they don’t want them to get any rights. They don’t want to pay them fairly. They don’t want them to be able to bargain collectively. They don’t want them to be able to get occupational safety and standards. And that is what’s really going on.”“And these trade agreements, you know, they allow capital to travel other borders, and all capital is, is people who happen to own something we call a corporation, which is a legal arrangement which gives them special rights. And labor, which is a regular person, cannot travel back and forth across the border. And so corporations, certain people who get certain rights, can go back and forth across the border seeking out the lowest wages, but people, regular people, cannot go back and forth across the border seeking out the highest wages.

It creates an injustice.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Does the message the Democrats are using coincide with the city of San Francisco’s new announcement that they’ll be registering illegals to vote?Some San Francisco officeholders are excited that this is the week the city’s Department of Elections issued voter registration forms for illegal aliens.“We want to give immigrants the right to vote,” said Supervisor Norman Yee who represents District 7.But legal immigrants have been allowed to vote in local San Francisco elections; the new registration effort is for illegal aliens, or as the politicians say, “non-citizens.” –MRCTVWatch:﻿Check out their voter registration form:According to Greg Phillips of the VoteFraud.org organization, 3 million votes in the U.S. presidential election were cast by illegal aliens.If true, this would mean that Donald Trump still won the contest despite widespread vote fraud and almost certainly won the popular vote.“We have verified more than three million votes cast by non-citizens,” tweeted Phillips after reporting that the group had completed an analysis of a database of 180 million voter registrations.For decades, Democrats have been in favor of giving illegals special treatment, in hopes of obtaining their votes in future elections.

He goes on to discuss the good things he plans on doing with the GoFundMe money he has received. He wants to give back and pay it forward to help others.We've all seen the amazing story shared by Jenny about one of our bellhops, Walter Carr, but many have asked if we have any video from the moment CEO @LukeMarklin thanked Walter for the perseverance he demonstrated on his first day w/ @BellhopsMoving #TheWorldNeedsMoreWalters pic.twitter.com/mXrvI2JQoP— Bellhops (@BellhopsMoving) July 17, 2018Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Jenny Hayden Lamey posted this detailed account of what happened:Yesterday was a long day. But a good day. Chris and I woke up around 5:45am to get everything staged and ready for the movers. Around 6:30am the doorbell rang. It was a police officer. He proceeded to tell us that he had picked up “this nice kid” in Pelham early this morning. “The nice kid”, Walter, said that he was supposed to help us with our move today. It was his first day on the job with this moving company (Bellhops) and he was “training” today. The officer proceeded to tell us that the previous evening Walter’s car broke down and he didn’t know how he was going to get to work. So he left Homewood at MIDNIGHT and started WALKING to Pelham on 280.He WALKED ALL NIGHT to get from Homewood to Pelham. Because he needed to get to work. For those reading this that are not local, that’s over 20 Miles. You could tell how the officer told us this story that he had complete admiration for Walter and by my reaction he could tell I did too. The police officer said they picked him up earlier that morning, took him to get some breakfast and once they checked his story out, brought Walter to our house. We introduced ourselves to Walter and told the officer he was just fine to stay here with us until the rest of the crew arrived. I asked Walter if he wanted to go upstairs and rest until everyone else arrived. He declined and said he could go ahead and get started. So he began working alongside Chris and I before the rest of the crew arrived.We chatted while we were working together early yesterday morning. He loved my kitchen and said that it was exactly the kind of kitchen he would want. He was from New Orleans. He and his mother lost their home in Hurricane Katrina and they came and made their home in Birmingham. I asked him if he was tired from all that walking and he said replied that he wasn’t and that he had a 4 hour nap before he left at midnight. He said he made it Hoover around 2am and then to Pelham around 4am, that’s about when the officer picked him up and took him to get breakfast. He wore black Nike joggers which he commented that he intentionally wore because he knew he had to walk thru some pretty high grass on his middle-of-the-night trek. He looked at me in the eye and smiled and I felt like I had known him much longer. He was a Marine. I didn’t get anymore of the story. The rest of the crew arrived and then the craziness started. All of the young men that came to move us yesterday (9 in total) were some of the best young men I have met. Several of them were in college, engineering majors (you should have seen them putting together our beds!!), one of them starts PA school in the fall, some just working hard since high school, some of them had been with Bellhops a while and others had just started! With the way they worked together as a team, you would have thought they had worked together for years. They remembered all of our names and Zach and Chase just had the best time cutting up with them and shooting hoops when the day was done.I just can’t tell you how touched I was by Walter and his journey. He is humble and kind and cheerful and he had big dreams! He is hardworking and tough. I can’t imagine how many times on that lonely walk down 280 in the middle of the night did he want to turn back. How many times did he wonder if this was the best idea. How many times did he want to find a place to sit or lie down and wait til morning when he could maybe get someone to come pick him up and bring him back home. But he walked until he got here! I am in total awe of this young man!As the crew arrived one by one I saw them interacting in the street outside our house. Shaking each other’s hands and all of them just as cheerful and ready for the day as Walter was. Walter and I emerged from the house and one of the crew, Shawn, saw us and said to Walter “You must be one of the recruits…let me shake your hand. Thanks for showing up!” He extended his hand to shake Walter’s. He was in total appreciation to him for being there. I guess it may be common for a “recruit” as he referred to him as, to not show up leaving the rest of the crew without the extra man they were counting on. I just looked at Shawn and said, “you wouldn’t believe what he did to get here. Tell him Walter”. Walter said “I walked”. That was it. Humble. I asked him to share a little more and when he did, the crew was in awe of him too! I don’t know that Walter would have shared if I hadn’t asked him to. So yes, yesterday we moved. Yesterday was crazy. Yesterday was long and hard and hot. But…Walter.This might have changed Walter Carr’s life but it seems that he’s changed more lives than he’ll ever know:Jenny Hayden Lamey posted this to Facebook a few hours ago…“This night, he doesn’t walk alone.”The Pelham, Alabama Police Department tweeted this out:Proud to have encountered this young man.

DeSantis got a roadblock from Strzok but he kept hammering him with the question. He produced the groundwork that helped Rep. Jordan (see video below) eventually get the answer he needed.DeSantis also goes into why he believes the Democrats kept interrupting during testimony.Rep. Jim Jordan got the answers he needed after DeSantis’ previous questioning:THIS IS HUGE because it is the first time the FBI has admitted where the phony dossier came from…Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS gave it to Nellie Ohr who gave it to Bruce Ohr at the DOJ who gave it to the Peter Strzok at the FBI:The exchange between Jordan and Strzok is huge…Strzok repeatedly tries to stonewall but Jordan breaks through.Strzok: ""Mr. Ohr provided information to the FBI that included material that is what everybody is calling the dossier.""Fusion GPS didn't hire Nellie Ohr for her expertise.

Jordan asks over and over who Corn and Simpson are and then it gets to whether Strzok talked to Bruce Ohr….Note that Ohr was the only one Strzok spoke with about the dossier. It’s then very clear that what we’ve known all along is true: Glenn Simpson passed the dossier to Nellie Ohr who passed it to Bruce Ohr at the DOJ who passed it on to Strzok at the FBI…DEEP STATE!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bX9561LeOYOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE AND BRUCE OHR:We’ve been covering the curious case of DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr…What they did is so corrupt and underhanded! Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee’s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the “dossier.” Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn’t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it — which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn’t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we’re sure the main stream media will ignore it. The connection between a now demoted DOJ official and Fusion GPS just got closer. His wife worked for the opposition research firm responsible for THE ANTI-TRUMP DOSSIER!

891,12-Jul-18,"Trump-Hating FBI Agent Peter Strzok will be grilled before the House Judiciary Committee and House Oversight Committee in what should be an interesting testimony this morning.FBI Agent Peter Strzok had direct involvement in the Hillary Clinton’s private email server investigation in 2016, as well as special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s potential collusion colluded with Russia leading up to the 2016 presidential election.Fox News – Strzok, who is slated to testify in a public hearing before the House Judiciary Committee and House Oversight Committee Thursday, has been in political crosshairs for months over revelations of anti-Trump text messages exchanged with his lover, and former bureau colleague, Lisa Page.Strzok was in charge of investigating Hillary’s classified emails that were found on Huma Abedin’s husband, convicted pedophile, Anthony Weiner’s computer. Here is an example of one of Strzok’s texts addressing the investigation with his lover Lisa Page:Strzok will say in his opening statement, obtained by the Associated Press, that he has never allowed personal opinions to affect his work, that he knew information during the campaign that had the potential to damage then-candidate Donald Trump but never contemplated leaking it to the press, and that recent congressional focus on him is misguided and plays into “our enemies’ campaign to tear America apart.”So, what about the “insurance policy” Peter Strzok?GOP leaders are expected to grill Strzok over the slew of Trump-bashing texts he exchanged on his FBI phone while he worked on bureau investigations into Russian election meddling and Hillary Clinton’s email sever. Lawmakers are also expected to press Strzok on the impact of his political bias on any investigative decisions, though Horowitz ultimately found that despite the politically charged messages, there was no evidence that the bias had an impact on any prosecutorial decisions in the Clinton probe.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Watch:Strzok was on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team until the text messages were discovered. He was then reassigned to the FBI’s office of human resources. Just last month, Strzok was escorted from the bureau and lost his security clearance.In his opening statement though, Strzok will maintain that while his criticisms of Trump were “blunt,” there is “simply no evidence of bias in my professional actions.” ",fake

899,10-Jul-18,"The charge of arson for burning on federal land is what sparked the Bundy Protest and occupation of a wildlife refuge (SEE OUR PREVIOUS REPORT BELOW). The 41-day standoff was full of ups and downs but the death of LaVoy Finicum was devastating. What’s unbelievable is that the Hammond ranchers were ordered back to jail because a judge said they hadn’t fulfilled the minimum sentence even though evidence at the trial was “conflicting”.Fox News reports:President Trump just signed the order granting clemency to 76-year-old Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven Hammond, 49, who were convicted of arson in 2012 for fires that burned on federal land in 2001 and 2006. Though they served their original sentences for the conviction — Dwight serving three months, Steven serving one year — an appellate judge ruled in 2015 that the terms were too short under federal minimum sentencing laws and the Hammonds were resentenced to serve the mandatory minimum.Daily Mail reports:Arson on federal land carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, but after the Hammonds were originally sentenced, they argued that the five-year rule was unconstitutional, and the trial court agreed and imposed lesser sentences.But, in a statement from the US Attorney’s Office, federal law was eventually upheld.‘The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, upheld the federal law, reasoning that “given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense”,’ it said.‘The court vacated the original, unlawful sentences and ordered that the Hammonds be re-sentenced “in compliance with the law”,’“The Hammonds are multi-generation cattle ranchers in Oregon imprisoned in connection with a fire that leaked onto a small portion of neighboring public grazing land,” the White House said in a statement. “The evidence at trial regarding the Hammonds’ responsibility for the fire was conflicting, and the jury acquitted them on most of the charges.”OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE BUNDY STANDOFF CASE:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The Bundy family of Nevada joined with hard-core militiamen Saturday to take over the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, vowing to occupy the remote federal outpost 50 miles southeast of Burns – pictured below – for years.The occupation came shortly after an estimated 300 marchers – militia and local citizens both – paraded through Burns to protest the prosecution of two Harney County ranchers, Dwight Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond, who are to report to prison Monday.Posted on Facebook by Tim Davis on Saturday, 2 January 2016:THE STORY COULD SET THE STAGE FOR A WESTERN-STYLE SOAP OPERA:“I call it ‘as the sagebrush burns,’” said Erin Maupin of the long and storied history involving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), special interest groups and the cattle ranchers on the Steens Mountain of Oregon.The latest scene involved two ranchers being sentenced to five years in federal prison for inadvertantly burning about 140 acres of BLM rangeland in two separate fires, years ago. That is an area big enough to feed about three cow-calf pairs for a year in that neck of the woods.Dwight, 73 and son Steven, 46, admitted in a 2012 court case, to lighting two different fires. Both fires started on Hammonds’ private property. An August lightening storm started numerous fires and a burn ban was in effect while BLM firefighters fought those fires. Despite the ban, without permission or notification to BLM, Steven Hammond started several “back fires” in an attempt to save the ranch’s winter feed. The “back burn” fire break worked and protected the Hammond’s ranch. BLM firefighters saw the back-burn and called it into their headquarters as an “arson.”Sadly, wind drove the back-burn onto federal land, on which the Hammonds paid for grazing rights. Despite this, the US Attorney for Oregon prosecuted the two men, saying they committed arson against federal property along with nine other charges. The jury convicted the men of only two charges, starting the fires they readily admitted to starting.Arson against federal property calls for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years prison. The Hammonds argued that such minimum mandatory sentences were unconstitutional and a judge agreed. He sentenced the two men to LESS than the five years. Not satisfied, the US Attorney appealed and the Ninth US Circuit ordered the District Court to re-sentence the men in accordance with the statute.THE FIRES:The first, in 2001, was a planned burn on Hammonds’ own property to reduce juniper trees that have become invasive in that part of the country. That fire burned outside the Hammonds’ private property line and took in 138 acres of unfenced BLM land before the Hammonds got it put out. No BLM firefighters were needed to help extinguish the fire and no fences were damaged.Dwight’s wife Susan shared some crucial details in an exclusive interview with SuperStation95.“They called and got permission to light the fire,” she said, adding that was customary for ranchers conducting range management burns – a common practice in the area.“We usually called the interagency fire outfit – a main dispatch – to be sure someone wasn’t in the way or that weather would be a problem.” Susan said her son Steven was told that the BLM was conducting a burn of their own somewhere in the region that very same day, but that they believed there would be no problem with the Hammonds going ahead with their planned fire. The court transcript includes the same information in a recording from that phone conversation.In cross-examination of a prosecution witness, the court transcript also includes admission from Mr. Ward, a range conservationist that the 2001 fire improved the rangeland conditions on BLM.Maupin, a former range technician and watershed specialist who resigned from the BLM in 1999, said that collaborative burns between private ranchers and the BLM had become popular in the late 1990s because local university extension researchers were recommending it as a means to manage invasive juniper that steal water from grass and other cover.“Juniper encroachment had become an issue on the forefront and was starting to come to a head. We were trying to figure out how to deal with it on a large scale,” said the woman whose family also neighbored the Hammonds for a couple of years.“In 1999, the BLM started to try to do large scale burn projects. We started to be successful on the Steens Mountain especially when we started to do it on a large watershed scale as opposed to trying to follow property lines.”Because private and federal land is intermingled, collaborative burns were much more effective than individual burns that would cover a smaller area, Maupin said.Susan said the second fire, in 2006, was a backfire started by Steven to protect their property from lightening fires.“There was fire all around them that was going to burn our house and all of our trees and everything. The opportunity to set a back-fire was there and it was very successful. It saved a bunch of land from burning,” she remembers.The BLM asserts that one acre of federal land was burned by the Hammonds’ backfire and Susan says determining which fire burned which land is “a joke” because fire burned from every direction.Neighbor Ruthie Danielson also remembers that evening and agrees. “Lightening strikes were everywhere, fires were going off,” she said.Maupin said prescribed burns to manage juniper were common in the late 1990s and early 2000s, best done late in the fall when the days are cooler.Prescribed burns on federal land in their area have all but stopped due to pressure from “special interest groups,” Maupin said. As a result, wildfires now burn much hotter due to a “ladder” of material on the ground – grass, brush and trees.“The fires now burn really hot and they sterilize the ground. Then you have a weed patch that comes back.”Maupin said planned burning in cooler weather like the Hammonds chose to do improves the quality of the forage, and makes for better sage grouse habitat by removing juniper trees that suck up water and house raptors – a sage grouse predator.“JUSTICE FINALLY CAME”Thank goodness some justice finally came to this case! Citing “flagrant prosecutorial misconduct”, a federal judge dismissed charges against the Nevada rancher and three others…Cliven Bundy walks out of federal courthouse for first time in nearly two years pic.twitter.com/BHiqgAH8ht— David Ferrara (@randompoker) January 8, 2018Fox News reports:A federal judge dismissed all charged against rancher Cliven Bundy and three othersU.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro cited “flagrant prosecutorial misconduct” in her decision to dismiss all charges against rancher Cliven Bundy, two of his sons and another person.The embarrassment a federal judge dealt to government prosecutors last month in the Cliven Bundy case could be set to resume Monday, at a hearing to determine whether the cattle rancher who became a folk hero long before he beat the feds can be retried.U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro on Dec. 20 declared a mistrial in the high-profile case. It was only the latest, stunning development in the saga of the Nevada rancher, and served as a repudiation of the federal government. Navarro accused prosecutors of willfully withholding evidence from Bundy’s lawyers, in violation of the federal Brady rule.The Brady rule, named after the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case known as Brady v. Maryland, holds that failure to disclose such evidence violates a defendant’s right to due process.Navarro had suspended the trial earlier and warned of a mistrial when prosecutors released information after a discovery deadline. Overall, the government was late in handing over more than 3,300 pages of documents. Further, some defense requests for information that ultimately came to light had been ridiculed by prosecutors as “fantastical” and a “fishing expedition.”“Either the government lied or [its actions were] so grossly negligent as to be tantamount to lying,” Napolitano said. “This happened over and over again.”Navarro said Monday it was clear the FBI was involved in the prosecution and it was not a coincidence that most of the evidence that was held back – which would have worked in Bundy’s favor – came from the FBI, AZCentral reported.ANOTHER BLACK EYE FOR THE FBI AND COMEY…",fake

901,09-Jul-18,"President Trump has just nominated 53-year-old Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court.President Trump praised the George W. Bush appointed federal appeals court judge.“There is no one in America more qualified for this position, and no one more deserving. This incredibly qualified candidate deserves a swift confirmation.”President Donald Trump has picked Brett Kavanaugh, a federal appeals court judge with extensive legal credentials and a lengthy political record, to succeed Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court.“Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials,” Trump said, shortly after announcing his pick. “Throughout legal circles, he is considered a true judge’s judge.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Kavanaugh, 53, is an ideological conservative who is expected to push the court to the right on a number of issues including business regulation and national security. The favorite of White House Counsel Donald McGahn, Kavanaugh is also considered a safer pick than some of the more partisan choices who were on the president’s shortlist.A graduate of Yale Law School who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh has the traditional trappings of a presidential nominee to the high court.If confirmed, the appellate judge would become the second young, conservative jurist Trump has put on the top U.S. court during his first term. Kavanaugh’s confirmation would give the president an even bigger role in shaping U.S. policy for decades to come. The potential to morph the federal judiciary led many conservatives to support Trump in 2016, and he has not disappointed so far with the confirmation of conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and numerous federal judges.At times, he has diverged from the Republican party’s ideological line on important cases that have come before him, including on the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care law which Kavanaugh has declined to strike down on a number of occasions in which it has come before him.Anti-abortion groups quietly lobbied against Kavanaugh, pushing instead for another jurist on Trump’s shortlist, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett, ABC News reported in the run-up to Trump’s announcement.Kavanaugh received his current appointment in 2006 after five years in the George W. Bush administration, where he served in a number of roles including staff secretary to the president. He has been criticized for his attachment to Bush, as well as his involvement in a number of high-profile legal cases. – CNBCBrett Kavanaugh, Pres.

Voting by non-citizens is another one 0f those sneaky nudges that you know won’t end with just voting in municipal races. Remember that the end justifies the means with this crowd so they really don’t care how they get there…they just want votes, votes, votes.This is similar to the nudge we got when it was illegal aliens and then illegal immigrants and then undocumented immigrants and then undocumented Americans and now it’s DREAMers…See what they did there? NUDGING is what they do and it’s dangerous! We now have illegal aliens who have more rights than we do and are bullying us into open borders OR ELSE…The nudge on voting is when the left claims the non-citizen is only voting for trash day or dog catcher…not to worry, right? Well, what they don’t tell you is that the local elections are very important because you’re electing mayor and city council too. That’s a big deal! The next nudge will come when the cities ask why the non-citizens can’t just go ahead and vote in federal or state elections. Why not? Can you picture the protests now?This is the slippery slope we’ve been talking about for over a year. Several cities have already voted to allow non-citizens to vote in their municipal races but now we have the big city of Boston“MAKE CITY ELECTIONS MORE INCLUSIVE”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The Boston Globe reports that City Council is holding a hearing on Tuesday to explore ways to “make city elections more inclusive” by “allowing immigrants with legal status in the country the right to vote in municipal races.”In 2017, there were roughly 6,300 DACA recipients in Boston. If the city council allows the changes, they could be included in those who are granted voting rights — along with legal permanent residents and visa holders.The changes would allow non-citizens to vote in local races such as mayor and city council, but they would still be unable to vote in federal or state elections.According to Council President Andrea Campbell, who called for the hearing, Boston has 190,000 non-citizen residents, which represents 28 percent of the city population.Hyde Park City Councilor Tim McCarthy has promised to push back against the effort.“Voting is a U.S. citizen’s privilege, it’s the ultimate privilege,” McCarthy told the Boston Herald. “And I for one will continue to fight that it remains that way. … Voting for noncitizens is a step too far.”",fake
903,09-Jul-18,"Former President Jimmy Carter just had a WWJDF (What Would Jesus Do) moment during a HuffPost Live interview with notorious lefty Mark Lamont Hill. Carter spoke openly and even moved the conversation back to abortion when Hill changed the subject. We think you might be surprised at how he feels about abortion and gay marriage.Carter said he believes Jesus would not approve of abortions aside for a few exceptions:“I have a hard time believing that Jesus, for instance, would approve abortions unless it was because of rape or incest or saving the mother’s life or some danger.”WE reports:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Carter, who served as president from 1977-1981, said he has struggled over the years to personally accept the Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark decision in Roe v. Wade that recognized a woman’s constitutional right to have an abortion.“I have had a problem with abortion. This has been a longtime problem of mine,” he explained. “My oath of office was to obey the Constitution and the laws of this country as interpreted by the Supreme Court, so I went along with that. But that’s been the only caveat.”Life News reports:In recent years, Carter has said Democrats should moderate their extreme pro-abortion position supporting abortion on demand paid for at taxpayer expense. Carter said toning down the stridently pro-abortion position would help win back Republicans who abandoned the Democrats because of abortion and other liberal social issue positions.Carter has recently talked about the problem with sex-selection abortions.CARTER ON GAY MARRIAGE:He does think Jesus would approve of same-sex marriage.“I believe he would,” Carter said, adding that he believes Jesus would encourage marriage between same-sex or heterosexual couples as long as it was “honest and sincere.”“Everybody should have a right to get married, regardless of their sex. The only thing I would draw a line on, I wouldn’t be in favor of the government being able to force a local church, congregation to perform gay marriages if they didn’t want to,” he continued.",fake

Everyone of us who has ever held a child in their arms, and every human being with a sense of compassion and decency should be outraged.” She said she warned about Trump’s immigration policies during the 2016 campaign.Three days later, she was back again, saying that her group, Onward Together, raised $1 million and would split it among organizations working to change border policy, including the American Civil Liberties Union and a gaggle of immigrant, refugee, Latino and women’s groups.And the day after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his retirement, Clinton introduced a newly minted resistance partner.

905,08-Jul-18,"The hardscrabble biography of Democrat Congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been called into question after the revelation that she grew up mostly in wealthy Westchester County.Though Ocasio-Cortez, 28, was born in and currently lives in the Bronx, county land records show her late father Sergio Cortez-Roman bought a quaint three-bedroom in Yorktown Heights, New York in 1991, when she was about two.It is an apparent contradiction with the candidate’s official biography, which states in part: ‘The state of Bronx public schools in the late 80s and early 90s sent her parents on a search for a solution. She ended up attending public school 40 minutes north in Yorktown, and much of her life was defined by the 40-minute commute between school and her family in the Bronx.’Ocasio-Cortez also boasted on Stephen Colbert’s late-night show that President Donald Trump, born in Queens, wouldn’t know how to handle ‘a girl from the Bronx’ such as herself.Little-known before her shock Democratic primary defeat of 10-term Congressional incumbent Joe Crowley on Tuesday night, Ocasio-Cortez has featured her own hard-luck biography as a key selling point in her insurgent campaign.With New York’s 14th district, encompassing parts of the Bronx and Queens, leaning heavily Democrat, she is believed to be a shoo-in for the House in the November general election.Ocasio-Cortez was born in 1989 to parents Sergio Ocasio-Roman, who was born in New York City, and mother Blanca Ocasio-Cortez, a native of Puerto Rico.Her father, who tragically died from lung cancer in 2008, was an architect and the CEO of Kirschenbaum & Ocasio-Roman Architects, PC, which focused on remodeling and renovations.Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign biography describes her father as ‘a small business owner’.‘She grew up in a working-class household where her mother cleaned homes and everyone pitched in on the family business,’ the bio continues.Initially, the young family lived in Parkchester, a planned community of 171 mid-rise brick buildings in the Bronx.When she was about five, Ocasio-Cortez’s family moved to the house in Westchester County, a detail that the bio omits.The timing of the move is confirmed in a New York Times interview with mother Blanca Ocasio-Cortez, but the report does not address the discrepancy.The home, a single-story with a finished basement, most recently sold for $355,000 in 2016. The median annual income in the area is $116,741, compared to the median annual income of $48,315 in Parkchester’s zip code, according to the latest Census data.‘It was clear to her, even then, that the zip code a child was born in determined much of their destiny,’ Ocasio-Cortez’s official bio reads. –Daily Mail

I finished with every section except the microphones, and when I went up there, another customer recognized me from Tucker [Carlson Tonight]”Straka said that the other customer was excited to meet him, pulled up the clip of Straka on the popular cable news show, and asked for a picture. He was excited to meet a fan.“I was like, ‘cool,’ I made his day,” Straka said.But then things turned nasty.The employee in the microphone section who overheard the conversation refused to sell any equipment to Straka because it would be used for “alt-right purposes.” Straka asked that Big League Politics not name the employee.Straka said that the employee was a fellow gay man and that when he tried to explain what #WalkAway was, the employee was not interested in having a conversation. Straka was directed to another employee at the store who completed the sale. Straka could not help but point out the irony. He is trying to help liberate the political left from closed-mindedness and was bewildered that another gay man, supposedly a tolerant liberal, would not simply hear him out.Favor- PLZ do not retaliate against this camera shop.

916,04-Jul-18,"Unfortunately, the left has fallen prey to the belief that many Americans hold, which is that Lady Liberty has something to do with immigration; that is just not at all the case. The Statue of Liberty represents Libertas, Roman goddess of Liberty.  The words on it were to commemorate July 4th, 1776.The famous poem that does refer to immigration was a part of a poem called The New Colossus, and it included the lines, “Give me your tired, give me your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” The poem was not part of the creation of the Statue of Liberty and was not delivered with the Statue of Liberty. It was written by Emma Lazarus as a part of a contest to help raise money for the statue’s pedestal.  A bronze tablet bearing the Emma Lazarus poem was only put inside the pedestal in 1903.RUSH LIMBAUGH CALLED OUT OBAMA ON HIS LIES ABOUT THE STATUE OF LIBERTY:There ya go!Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED ON THE HISTORY OF THE STATUE…A left-leaning twist mixed with facts…When the Goddess of Liberty was given to the United States, its donor’s agenda was to burnish France’s republican roots after the oppressive reign of Napoleon III and to celebrate the two nations’ commitment to the principles of liberty.The only immigrants mentioned at the dedication in 1886 were the “illustrious descendants of the French nobility” who fought on behalf of the United States against Britain during the American Revolution.THE TIMES TRIES TO MAKE IT ABOUT IMMIGRATION…IT’S NOT!IT’S A POEM…NOT A POLICY FOR IMMIGRATION!But it was the words of a fourth-generation American whose father was a wealthy sugar refiner and whose great-great-uncle welcomed George Washington to Newport, R.I., that almost single-handedly transformed the monumental statue in New York Harbor into the “Mother of Exiles” that would symbolically beckon generations of immigrants.Emma Lazarus’s poem only belatedly became synonymous with the Statute of Liberty, whose 125th birthday as a gift from France will be celebrated on Friday by the National Park Service. Lazarus’s “New Colossus,” with its memorable appeal to “give me your tired, your poor,” was commissioned for a fund-raising campaign by artists and writers to pay for the statue’s pedestal.But while the poem was critically acclaimed — the poet James Russell Lowell wrote that he liked it “much better than I like the Statue itself” because it “gives its subject a raison d’être which it wanted before quite as much as it wants a pedestal” — it was not even mentioned at the dedication ceremony.Finally in 1903, after relentless lobbying by a friend of Lazarus who was descended from Alexander Hamilton, himself an immigrant, it was “affixed to the pedestal as an ex post facto inscription,” the art historian Marvin Trachtenberg wrote.“Gradually, thereafter, the awareness spread not only of the significance of the lines of the poem but also of the significance of the aspect of national tradition it expressed,” another historian, Oscar Handlin, wrote. “Liberty was not simply the bond between ancient allies; nor was it only the symbol of liberal ideas of justice and freedom; it was also the motive force that had peopled the wilderness and made the country that emerged what it was.”Barry Moreno, a historian of the statue for the National Park Service, recalled that it “was never built for immigrants.”“It was,” he recalled, “built to pay tribute to the United States of America, the Declaration of Independence, American democracy, and democracy throughout the world. It honored the end of slavery, honored the end of all sorts of tyranny and also friendship between France and America.”THE LEFT HIJACKS THE MEANING OF THE STATUE:Only later, he added, “letters were written home, word of mouth, taught people that you would see this wonderful goddess in New York Harbor when you arrived in America to welcome you.”“And she became really famous among immigrants,” he recalled. “And it was really immigrants that lifted her up to a sort of a glory that was probably before America really fully embraced her.”Lazarus, who popularized that “wonderful goddess,” accepted the commission only begrudgingly — few poets relish the idea of writing on demand. But she was stirred by a wave of pogroms against Jews in Russia and by her regular visits to poor immigrants housed in temporary shelters on Wards Island. She would make “The New Colossus” the first entry in a compendium of poems she anthologized shortly before her death from Hodgkin’s disease at 38 in 1887.The poem went unmentioned in her obituary in The New York Times, but it appeared in a brief article in 1903 when the plaque was dedicated. (An exhibition on Lazarus, the “Poet of Exiles,” opens Wednesday at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Lower Manhattan.A manuscript of the poem is at the Center for Jewish History.)“Emma Lazarus was the first American to make any sense of this statue,’’ said Esther Schor, an English professor at Princeton and author of a biography titled “Emma Lazarus.”“Conceived by the French statesman Édouard René de Laboulaye, the statue was to propound the values of the French Revolution, in a sort of end-run around the repressive Second Empire of Napoleon III,” Professor Schor said. “But Americans were so unmoved and uninterested that it was hard to raise money simply to build a pedestal to support it.”For Lazarus, who wrote the sonnet in 1883 having seen only the torch when it was on display for a fund-raising drive in Madison Square Park, “it was a moment of moral and spiritual recovery, after her attempts to raise money to benefit the Russian-Jewish refugees of 1881-82 had largely fallen on deaf ears,” Professor Schor said.Instead of retreating, she broadened her appeal to all immigrants, Professor Schor said. For her “the statue was a special kind of mother — a ‘mother of exiles’ — a mother whose mission is not to reproduce herself, but rather to adopt the abandoned, the orphaned, the persecuted,” she said.“She’s tender and accepting,” Professor Schor said, “but also fiercely protective, and her iconoclastic message smashes the icons of enlightenment and imperialism.”The sonnet would survive periodic efforts to excise her reference to “wretched refuse” and would become enshrined in the political lexicon in the 1930s as an anthem for Americans who, with war again threatening in Europe, lobbied to reverse anti-immigration quotas that had been imposed a decade earlier.“The irony is that the statue goes on speaking, even when the tide turns against immigration — even against immigrants themselves, as they adjust to their American lives,’’ Professor Schor said. “You can’t think of the statue without hearing the words Emma Lazarus gave her.” ",fake

One man is in custody.Police say that the girls got away from their captors at the Days Inn, which is where the men also were staying. Their mother and stepfather rushed the girls to Wood County Hospital to be examined, and that’s when emergency room personnel contacted the Bowling Green Police Division.Search warrants were served at the Days Inn and based on evidence uncovered, they were able to identify four suspects in the alleged attack.Simon Juan Thomas, 24, of Guatemala, has been arrested and charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor and is being held on $50,000 bond, with 100 percent required. His three alleged accomplices are on the loose and Bowling Green Police believe they left the Bowling Green area.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Nationwide warrants are out for the arrest of David Ramos Contreras, Arnulfo Ramos, and Juan Adiel.Complicating the investigation is that the men are not U.S. citizens and police say they all had fake ID cards and documentation.

They continue to grasp at straws to try and destroy President Trump or anyone surrounding himU.S. District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle said that the suit’s efforts to tie the Trump campaign to the nation’s capital were too flimsy for the case to proceed in a D.C. court.“The Trump Campaign’s efforts to elect President Trump in D.C. are not suit-related contacts for those efforts did not involve acts taken in furtherance of the conspiracies to disseminate emails that harmed plaintiffs,” wrote Huvelle, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. “Campaign meetings, canvassing voters, and other regular business activities of a political campaign do not constitute activities related to the conspiracies alleged in the complaint.”Stone, who worked both as a formal and informal adviser to the Trump campaign, exchanged digital messages during the election with WikiLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, an online persona that U.S. officials have said was a Russian front for disseminating the stolen DNC files. Various meetings between Trump aides and Kremlin-linked individuals have also come out since the election.The DNC was not a party to the suit that two donors and the former staffer filed last July.

All of a sudden we went from illegal alien to illegal immigrant to undocumented immigrant to refugee…The left is now trying to pass these lawbreakers off as refugees:Enter the current occupant of the White House, who devotes this nation’s potent energies to barricading the borders, to separating refuge-seeking (yes, this was a misspelling by the NYDN) mothers from children, to ordering parents to leave the country with or without their kids now that a court has ordered their reunion.Later on in the article the refugees are now “migrants”: President Trump’s cruelty in deflecting entry of desperate migrants…What they get wrong is that President Trump is all for LEGAL IMMIGRATION to America! He knows that our immigration policy needs to be enforced and reformed. He also knows very well the danger of having open borders and is trying to fulfill his duty as president to keep Americans safe…that includes protecting our borders by building a wall.Publications like the NYDN are carrying the water for the left just like so many other main stream media sources.

Well, here’s your vision…DNC chair Tom Perez said in an interview on the “Bill Press Show” that Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is “the future of the party.”Perez was a guest with Bill Press when he brought up Ocasio-Cortez’s defeat of Democrat leader Joe Crowley to become the nominee for New York’s 14th Congressional District: “Twenty-eight years old, never ran for office before, big progressive. Calls herself a democratic socialist, actually, like Bernie Sanders did, she was a Bernie Sanders reporter.”Well, that’s one way to destroy the party! Perez is a seasoned radical with connections to La Raza so socialism is right in his wheelhouse. He wants the direction of the party to go even more towards the radical left…He also mentioned Maryland’s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous, a progressive with a very liberal platform.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]“What’s this tell you about where the Democratic Party is going today?” Press asked the DNC chair.Perez said his daughters both texted him about their excitement over Ocasio-Cortez’s win.“Because, she really, she represents the future of our party,” Perez said, complimenting the self-described Democratic socialist for running a “spirited campaign.”Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the New York City chapter of Democratic Socialists of America and her progressive platform includes calling for the abolishment of ICE, a federal jobs guarantee, and single-payer health care. ",fake

How is this fair to a student who has the same qualifications but just happens to be white or Asian? Harvard has gotten into hot water recently for having this policy and discriminating against Asian students (see video below).“RACE-NEUTRAL APPROACH”ABC reports:The Trump administration is moving to rescind Obama-era guidance that encouraged schools to take a person’s race into account to encourage diversity in admissions, a U.S. official said Tuesday.The shift would give schools and universities the federal government’s blessing to take a race-neutral approach to the students they consider for admission.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]A formal announcement was expected later Tuesday from the Justice and Education departments, according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan had not yet been disclosed.The guidance from the Obama administration gave schools a framework for “considering race to further the compelling interests in achieving diversity and avoiding racial isolation.” That approach replaced Bush-era policy from a decade earlier.The new guidance will not have the force of law, but schools will presumably be able to defend themselves from lawsuits by following administration policy.TUCKER CARLSON TOOK ON THE ISSUE:The Supreme Court in 2016 gave affirmative action policies a narrow victory in 2016 by upholding a University of Texas program that takes into account race in deciding whom to admit.

924,03-Jul-18," Texas Border Volunteers are working day and night to help keep illegal aliens from crossing over into the US.  The TBV rarely gets the credit they deserve, however, for preventing dangerous illegal aliens from entering Texas via Mexico. Meet the Texas Border Volunteers…
Just before sundown, a group of men cloaked in camouflage from the Texas Border Volunteers halts their all-terrain vehicle, along a winding sandy road. As they make their way around the heavy brush, they circle around a pile of women’s undergarments, which lay at the foot of a tree. In sections of land near the U.S.-Mexico border, this is known as a “rape tree.” And for the residents of Brooks County, Texas, rape trees are popping up at an alarming frequency.“I’ve had three rape cases in the last month,” says Benny Martinez, the chief deputy at the Brooks County Sheriff’s Department. “These guys are animals. There is an intimidation factor there. If they don’t give into the brush guide, [the women] get beat up.”The group who found the “rape tree” are part of the Texas Border Volunteers, a troop of a few dozen private citizens who spend their own time – six or seven hours at a clip – weaving through the low-hanging honey mesquite trees and heavy Texas brush looking to stop immigrants from crossing into this land – and their country – illegally.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Symbols like the rape tree serve as a reminder to volunteers or anyone passing through of the escalating brutality “coyotes” are using to control immigrants they lead through this land. The tree is a trafficker’s way of asserting power. But it also serves as a landmark for the border volunteers, allowing them to keep a record of immigrant migration patterns through the brush.When the Texas Border Volunteers head into the muggy summer night, each member gathers night vision goggles, flashlights, guns and folding chairs.They run their shift as if they had been given marching orders from a commanding officer. They run their operation like a military mission, with code names like “gumball” and “polecat” buzzing across their walkie-talkies.Founded in 2006, the Texas Border Volunteers began as a citizen response to the growing amount of property damage occurring on the wide swath of private ranch land in Brooks County, Texas, an area 70 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border. The county is home to the final border patrol checkpoint before human and drug smugglers funnel their inventory north. To get around the border patrol station, drivers often unload their cargo on desolate county roads and smuggle it through the dusty Texas fields for dozens of miles where they can hide among the thick landscape, sometimes for days.The volunteers who patrol the ranch lands come from all walks of life; a mix of retired military personnel, educators, small business owners and computer technicians. While some live in the area, others come all the way from north Texas, or even out of state, to lend a hand. When they aren’t on patrol, they sleep in a garage bunker or in tents on the ranch.Texas Border Volunteer Jim Gibson is wearing one of our Defend Your Constitution Before It’s Too Weak To Defend You T-shirts that can be found in our store on the 100percentfedup.com website.
Veterinarian and rancher Michael Vickers, who has lived in Brooks County since 1986, founded Texas Border Volunteers out of desperation.“They started cutting our fences and they broke into my house and tore up our water sources, breaking the floats off. And it has just been escalating,” Vickers says. “The groups are getting bigger and the people are more combative.”Vickers’ wife, Linda, never leaves the house without her cell phone, a gun and her four guard dogs.Ranchers in the area say immigrants used to pass through without much of a trace.“It used to be mostly Mexican peasants coming to look for work,” Vickers says. “Maybe a couple times a week, they’d show up at my front door, ring the doorbell and ask if I had any work for them. If I didn’t, I’d send them across the road or point them in the direction of work. They were very respectful. We’d give them water, we’d give them food.”Now, all along Route 281, bended fences, abandoned clothing and empty Gatorade bottles lay scattered on the road, evidence of groups passing through.

The waiter at The Red Hen said, “I just served Sarah Huckabee Sanders for a total of 2 minutes before my owner kicked her out along with 7 of her other family members.”Others say the owner didn’t want Huckabee Sanders in the restaurant out of “moral conviction.”A twitter post went viral when the director of Clean Virginia, a left-leaning energy focused nonprofit, shared the post from the waiter at Red Hen on Twitter, along with a handwritten note purportedly from the restaurant that reads, among other things, “86 — Sara Huckabee Sanders.”

Anyone who sees Kirstjen Nielsen at dinner, anyone who sees anyone who works at DHS and ICE at dinner can confront them like this, and that’s what we hope this will inspire people to do.”Despite Hrabar’s claims of keeping her personal politics outside of her time as an employee of the federal government, a look at her Twitter account, @allisongeroi, features tweets during the workday openly celebrating her behavior Tuesday night.“Keeping families together in jail is not an acceptable solution,” Hrabar tweeted Wednesday afternoon at 1:56 PM.",fake

927,01-Jul-18,"George Soros is still pulling the puppet strings for Obama and the radical left…moveon.org and other Soros-connected radical groups were out in full force for the immigration march yesterday. Soros and his son are behind the push for open borders. They’re dumping millions into continuing the “fundamental change” of America but evidence has surfaced of Soros and Obama interfering in foreign elections and “judicial reforms”…Judicial Watch obtained 32 pages of records showing the Obama administration sent U.S. taxpayers’ funds to a group backed by billionaire George Soros, which used the money to fund left-wing political activities in Albania, including working with the country’s socialist government to push for highly controversial judicial “reform.” The records also detail how the Soros operation helped the State Department review grant applications from other groups for taxpayer funding.The records were obtained in a May 26, 2017, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) after both the State Department and USAID failed to respond to March 31, 2017, FOIA requests (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (No. 1:17-cv-01012)). Judicial Watch agreed to dismiss the lawsuit after it received the documents and payment of attorneys’ fees.The new documents show USAID funds were funneled through that agency’s Civil Society Project to back Soros’s left-wing Open Society Foundations in Albania, particularly the Soros operation efforts to give the socialist government greater control of the judiciary. USAID reportedly gave $9 million in 2016 to the “Justice for All” campaign, which is overseen by Soros’s “East West Management Institute.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]In March 2017, a group of six U.S. Senators led by Sen.

Candace wasn’t always a conservative though, and she certainly didn’t come from a family with conservative views.During a conference at the Center of the American Experiment lunch forum, Owens explained to the crowd how she became a conservative, and how she didn’t exactly come from a conservative family.Owens told the crowd that her favorite, made-up story by the media is that she is a “rich girl from Connecticut”.

933,27-Jun-18,"If you’re looking for Google to help you find one of the most reputable sources for facts about illegal immigration in America, don’t be surprised when you’re essentially tricked into landing on one of the vilest, and most conservative hating organizations in America.Here’s what it looks like when you search on Google for CIS, the Center For Immigration Studies. Note, that the top search box prominently displayed at the top of the page is actually a link to a page on the SPLC site that trashes the reputable, fact-based CIS organization. Note, the SPLC link at the top of the search is not identified as a paid “Ad”. :Here is the actual link to CIS: https://cis.orgHere’s a video showing uncovering the scary truth about the SPLC organization:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]CIS reports have been widely criticized and debunked by groups such as the Immigration Policy Center and the CATO Institute. Alex Nowasteh, an Immigration Policy Analyst at CATO said in early 2017, “Oh, I’m convinced that [CIS executive director Mark Krikorian is] wrong about all the facts and issues. They’re wrong about the impact of immigrants on the U.S. economy and on U.S. society.”On Twitter, Alex Nowrasteh openly hates President Trump, defends DACA and despises Trump’s travel ban from terror-hotbed nations.Invade? You all should tamp down on the absurd hyperbole coming from the mouth of the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES before lecturing the rest of us. https://t.co/l2nul5o39Y— (((The Alex Nowrasteh))) (@AlexNowrasteh) June 26, 2018SCOTUS' decision in the travel ban cases means that they're coming for DACA next.— (((The Alex Nowrasteh))) (@AlexNowrasteh) June 26, 2018The Southern Poverty Law Center article uses radical leftist Congressman Luis Gutierrez to refute the highly reputable CIS group.Speaking about CIS to Univision in August of 2017, Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez stated, “Their research is always questionable because they torture the data to make it arrive at the conclusion they desire, which is that immigrants are criminals and a burden on the U.S. and our economy. It is the worst kind of deception, but politicians, the conservative media and some Americans eat it up because it always looks somewhat legitimate at first glance.” CIS has also defended the usage of “anchor babies” and released a report on “terror babies,” popular concepts among the nativist movement.Here’s an example of  CIS’s Jessica Vaughan’s Congressional testimony regarding Sanctuary Cities and the threat they pose to American citizens  that Rep. Luis Gutierrez criticized:While capable of appearing as a sober-minded policy analyst in some settings, longtime CIS executive director Mark Krikorian’s contributions to the immigration policy debate rarely rise above petulant commentary dashed with extremist statements. Often, these statements are highly revealing.In the article, Google features at the top of the search for CIS, the SPLC exposes its extreme radical views by attempting to destroy the character of Mark Krikorian, the highly-respected expert on immigration, by picking a few ridiculous quotes from his decades’ long career that most people would consider incocuous.At his perch at the National Review and on Twitter Krikorian has asked “How many rapists & drug-dealers are the anti-deportation radicals protecting?” and argued that Mexico’s “weakness and backwardness has been deeply harmful to the United States.” Krikorian has called Mexican-American journalist Jorge Ramos a “white-Hispanic ethnic hustler” and riffed that if the U.S. was a police state, as Chelsea Manning claimed, then “this mentally ill traitor would have been dumped in a shallow grave years ago.” In one exchange on Twitter, Krikorian tried to whitewash the role eugenicists played in the 1924 Immigration Act only to stop responding when Harry H. Laughlin’s role in advancing the legislation was mentioned. Laughlin was the most prominent eugenics advocate prior to WWII and went on to co-found the racist pseudoscience promoting Pioneer Fund, which Tanton had close ties to through the 90s.Finally, it wouldn’t be a SPLC hit piece on a conservative or conservative group without finding a way to tie them to alleged “racism” that is also somehow tied to President Trump or his administration:More recently, CIS has been in the headlines for its connections to Trump Administration adviser Stephen Miller, a man who in college collaborated with white nationalist Richard Spencer to bring another white nationalist, Peter Brimelow, onto campus for a debate on immigration. Miller has been instrumental in pushing for anti-immigrant policies in the Trump White House and has regularly drawn from CIS. In early 2017, Miller made the rounds on national media defending the Trump administration’s Muslim ban by citing the CIS. “First of all, 72 individuals, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, have been implicated in terroristic activity in the United States who hail from those seven nations, point one,” Miller said on NBC’s Meet the Press. Fact-checkers at The Washington Post debunked the talking point, which collapsed several categories of crimes related to terrorism to reach a higher number, and awarded it “Three Pinocchios.”Here’s who the CIS actually is from their website:The Center for Immigration Studies is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit, research organization. Since our founding in 1985, we have pursued a single mission – providing immigration policymakers, the academic community, news media, and concerned citizens with reliable information about the social, economic, environmental, security, and fiscal consequences of legal and illegal immigration into the United States.The Center is governed by a diverse board of directors that has included active and retired university professors, civil rights leaders, and former government officials. Our research and analysis has been funded by contributions and grants from dozens of private foundations, from the U.S. Census Bureau and Justice Department, and from hundreds of generous individual donors.Our board, our staff, our researchers, and our contributor base are not predominantly “liberal” or predominantly “conservative.” Instead, we believe in common that debates about immigration policy that are well-informed and grounded in objective data will lead to better immigration policies.The ranking of articles to support a leftist narrative is nothing new. A quick search of 100 Percent Fed Up shows our website followed by an obscure fake fact-checking site designed to harm our credibility with no rhyme or reason behind their methodology, and then our Facebook page with almost 2 million followers is listed below the fake fact-checking site.  Next on the list is our Twitter account, followed by two more unreliable “fact-checking” websites.

The appointment of the special counsel creates new crimes….obstruction of justice, tampering with witnesses.”“I think we end with a report, a report that is probably very critical of the President and that does not recommend indictment or does not indict him, because a sitting president can’t be indicted, and doesn’t come to any conclusion regarding impeachment, just says ‘here’s the things that he did, now Congress, you consider impeachment’.”Dershowitz passionately warns, “In my forthcoming book, I strongly recommend the case against impeachment.”Dershowitz goes on to explain why the 2016 election was a disaster and even admits that he voted for Hillary.

The child is taken into the custody of HHS, who cares for them at temporary shelters.The criminal proceedings are exceptionally short, assuming there is no aggravating factor such as a prior illegal entity or another crime. The migrants generally plead guilty, and they are then sentenced to time served, typically all in the same day, although practices vary along the border. After this, they are returned to the custody of ICE.If the adult then wants to go home, in keeping with the expedited order of removal that is issued as a matter of course, it’s relatively simple. The adult should be reunited quickly with his or her child, and the family returned home as a unit. In this scenario, there’s only a very brief separation.Where it becomes much more of an issue is if the adult files an asylum claim. In that scenario, the adults are almost certainly going to be detained longer than the government is allowed to hold their children.

Now we have Democrats practically busting the doors down to get into these detention facilities.

We captured a few local news stories with photos but you really had to dig to find them. The difference in policy basically is open borders versus enforcing the law. Under Obama, the illegals were released but ordered to come back for an immigration hearing…WHAT A JOKE! Do you think any these people made an effort to come back for a hearing? Nope!

WE DON’T THINK SO!“Border Patrol agents have confirmed that the new arrivals are saying that they know they will be released after they are processed,” said Jessica M. Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies. “They have heard this from family and friends who have gone before and shared their experience. They use social media to communicate this, sometimes even texting pictures of what they call their ‘permiso,’ which is the document they get showing them to appear for a court date years in the future.”Thanks to Obama, the 2015 border surge brought thousands and thousands of families who had gotten word that they had “permiso” to enter the U.S.There are a few reports but you won’t see them on the main stream media because they want to use this issue to destroy the Republicans in the midterms.

959,16-Jun-18,"Two days ago, a leaked draft of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) amnesty deal revealed that if passed, it could lead to the “biggest” amnesty for illegal aliens in United States history.Prior to the 2016 election, Gang of Eight member, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) made a prediction during an interview with Politico: Republicans are going to get thrashed in the November election, especially among Latinos. And it’s going to trigger another run at immigration reform in Congress next year, the South Carolina senator says.Senator Graham, like the majority of Democrats (we consider Lindsey to be a de facto member of the Democrat Party), predicted Hillary would win would win the White House and the Republicans would see Democrats win a majority in both the House and Senate.The RINO Senator could not have been more wrong. That didn’t stop Senator Graham, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and several other Republican lawmakers from caving to the Democrat Party on amnesty with their latest amnesty scheme, in spite of the fact that President Trump and many of the Republican lawmakers who were elected in 2016 promised the American people they would build a wall and fix our broken immigration system.A recent Numbers USA poll shows that across the board, in every category, Americans want to see a reduction in immigration.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Breitbart News is reporting that Ryan’s immigration deal would go beyond giving amnesty to only the nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.According to a leaked draft of the amnesty deal, obtained by Breitbart News, Ryan’s plan would allow the entire “DACA population” to be eligible for amnesty so long as they meet low educational, work and criminal requirements, prompting the amnesty to explode in size.Numbers USA Governmental Affairs Director Rosemary Jenks told Breitbart News that Ryan’s amnesty will — at the least — allow 1.8 million illegal aliens to stay in the U.S.“This has the potential to turn into the biggest amnesty we’ve ever had,” Jenks said.The leaked amnesty deal reveals that Ryan and the Republican establishment may even be considering going beyond giving amnesty to DACA illegal aliens.“The winners are the DREAMers cause they get their amnesty, Democrats because they don’t have to concede much to get the amnesty and donor-class Republicans who are interested in perpetuating the current system,” Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan told Breitbart News of Ryan’s leaked amnesty deal.Rep. Steve King (R-IA) told Breitbart News Tonight earlier this week that House Republicans are considering forcibly removing House Speaker Paul Ryan from the speakership via a “motion to vacate the chair” over Ryan’s efforts to undermine President Donald Trump’s agenda.“It’s kind of odd that he has as much power as he has,” King said of Ryan during the appearance on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel with Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on Breitbart News Tonight earlier this week. “But I do predict, and it is happening, that that power is diminishing. I also have got information that there are–I’ll say ‘members’–I say that plurally, with knowledge, that are considering introducing a motion to vacate the chair. If they do that, that will throw this place into a tizzy and force the kind of election for a Speaker that may bring out someone who is a lot stronger on this.”A motion to vacate the chair would call a referendum on Ryan’s speakership to the floor. It could force a vote on whether Republicans want Ryan to remain as speaker as a lame duck for the rest of the year, especially after all these failures in strategy and his efforts to undermine the president with an amnesty bill that the president opposes and said he “certainly” would never sign.Ryan claimed, falsely, to House Republican members recently in a conference meeting that the president did support the Ryan amnesty bill–something the president confirmed on Fox and Friends on Friday morning was not true. The president opposes the bill and Ryan’s continued claims that Trump did back the bill are now proven to be false.Watch President Trump tell Steve Doocy of “Fox and Friends” that he won’t support Ryan’s “more moderate” bill starting at the 6:30 mark:The fact that sitting House Republican members are contemplating calling forth a motion to vacate the chair–the same mechanism forced Ryan’s predecessor, now former House Speaker John Boehner into early retirement–is remarkable. He announced earlier this year he intends to serve out the rest of this term in Congress then retire at the beginning of next year. That thrust Ryan into a lame duck status in the speakership, meaning he has lost a significant amount of influence. –Breitbart NewsPreviously, Kansas Secretary of State and gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach told Breitbart Newsthat a DACA amnesty — even one smaller than this amnesty plan — would potentially cause a surge of one million illegal immigrants rushing the southern border.",fake

Why do you Republicans insist on insulting your own voters? It’s not a cult. You guys just don’t know the perspective. You don’t have the proper the perspective to look at this. I’m gonna tell you. I’m gonna try to help you, Senator, after the break. You’re looking at this the entirely wrong way.Now, Senator Corker. He doesn’t understand how Never Trump candidates keep losing, and therefore he doesn’t understand how pro-Trump candidates keep winning. And we just played a sound bite with Senator Corker referring to this as a “cult,” and it’s really a bad thing, he said. It’s a bad thing when your party turns into a cult. Senator Corker, this isn’t a cult by any stretch of the imagination. Donald Trump does not have a Svengali hold on these people. In fact, Senator, if you want to know the truth, Donald Trump is not the cause of all this.Donald Trump is the beneficiary. Donald Trump had the ability to understand where a majority of Republican voters were and what they were thinking and how fed up they were about certain things, and Donald Trump came along, and he spoke their language. He validated what they were thinking, and he has become their champion, because nobody else in your party stepped up! But these people weren’t running around aimless, and then Trump as a Svengali shows up and starts spinning tales and has them mesmerized into a cult.Senator Corker, you gotta stop looking at things as this battle being left versus right or Republican versus Democrat. What you have to understand, Senator, is this new paradigm, if you will, is inside versus outside — and Never Trumpers are the essence of inside. And inside equals stagnant. Inside equals little guy doesn’t matter. Inside equals whatever globalists want to do and however much it harms average citizens, they’re gonna do it.They’re simply tired of not being represented by you, Senator, and your colleagues. The people who’ve been voting for you don’t think you’ve been representing them. They think you’re representing yourself and your other buddies and special interests inside the political class of Washington. Donald Trump has come along and — in a year and a half — has fixed things that people like you and others have said can’t be fixed, and certainly not in this period of time, and we must go slow, and we must be deliberate.You gotta understand, Senator, there’s nothing wrong with people thinking they’re losing their country because of open borders. They see it happening in Europe; they see it happening in California; they don’t want it happening to them. They want it stopped. People inside Washington want the borders open for whatever stupid reasons, and that’s the divide.There’s nothing cultish about this. It’s just you haven’t taken the time to understand their values. You haven’t taken the time to understand their circumstances. You haven’t taken the time to give credence to what they think. Trump did. Trump does. But Trump is in this for different reasons too. Trump’s not cognizant of any cult that he has. He doesn’t have a cult.Donald Trump personally wants America to be great. He’s an American, he wants it to be great as it can be. He’s tired of watching it go in the wrong direction. He personally set out a course to try to fix it and change it. A bunch of people agree with him, and they’re supporting him. There’s no cult there.This isn’t hard to understand. But if you inside the Beltway do not even understand what people believe to be a genuine crisis in the country, culturally and economically, then you’re never gonna understand what’s going on. You’re gonna continue to spite it and hold it in contempt. But it’s real.The idea that there’s some kind of a cult is simply a lazy way of dismissing it, a lazy way of not having to explain why your side keeps losing! ‘Cause you don’t want to get down to the substance that might explain that.

They are what Jordan Peterson calls “the post-modernists:” neo-Marxist professors who dominate our colleges and universities. And here’s the worst part: we are financing these nihilists with tax dollars, alumni gifts and tuition payments. Time to wise up.TRANSCRIPT:
You may not realize it, but you are currently funding some dangerous people.They are indoctrinating young minds throughout the West with their resentment-ridden ideology. They have made it their life’s mission to undermine Western civilization itself, which they regard as corrupt, oppressive and “patriarchal.”If you’re a taxpayer—or paying for your kid’s liberal arts degree—you’re underwriting this gang of nihilists.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]You’re supporting ideologues who claim that all truth is subjective; that all sex differences are socially constructed; and that Western imperialism is the sole source of all Third World problems. They are the post-modernists, pushing “progressive” activism at a college near you.They produce the mobs that violently shut down campus speakers; the language police who enshrine into law use of fabricated gender pronouns; and the deans whose livelihoods depend on madly rooting out discrimination where little or none exists.Their thinking took hold in Western universities in the ‘60s and ‘70s, when the true believers of the radical left became the professors of today. And now we rack up education-related debt—not so that our children learn to think critically, write clearly, or speak properly, but so they can model their mentors’ destructive agenda.It’s now possible to complete an English degree and never encounter Shakespeare—one of those dead white males whose works underlie our “society of oppression.”To understand and oppose the post-modernists, the ideas by which they orient themselves must be clearly identified.First is their new unholy trinity of diversity, equity and inclusion. Diversity is defined not by opinion, but by race, ethnicity or sexual identity; equity is no longer the laudable goal of equality of opportunity, but the insistence on equality of outcome; and inclusion is the use of identity-based quotas to attain this misconceived state of equity.All the classic rights of the West are to be considered secondary to these new values. Take, for example, freedom of speech—the very pillar of democracy. The post-modernists refuse to believe that people of good will can exchange ideas and reach consensus.Their world is instead a Hobbesian nightmare of identity groups warring for power. They don’t see ideas that run contrary to their ideology as simply incorrect. They see them as integral to the oppressive system they wish to supplant, and consider it a moral obligation to stifle and constrain their expression.For the complete TRANSCRIPT: PRAGER UPrager U has suffered through censorship of their YouTube videos.

The leaker has been arrested but it looks like the NYT reporter won’t be charged… THE SECURITY DIRECTOR IS A LEAKER? YOU JUST CAN’T MAKE THIS UP! A former Senate Intelligence Committee aide was arrested Thursday in an investigation of classified information leaks where prosecutors also secretly seized years’ worth of a New York Times reporter’s phone and email records.James A. Wolfe, 58, served as the panel’s security director for 29 years, according to the feds.NYT reports:The Intelligence Committee is responsible for carrying out oversight of American intelligence agencies, including the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency, and their secretive operations. It is one of the most tightly secured groups in Congress, with strict rules for lawmakers and the professional staff governing the circulation and release of sensitive, and often classified, information that passes before the committee.As security director, Mr. Wolfe would have been responsible for ensuring that those rules were upheld. When the committee became a matter of intense interest as it undertook a bipartisan investigation of Russia’s election meddling, Mr. Wolfe played a more visible role ushering witnesses in and out of the committee’s secured office space.Earlier Thursday, The New York Times revealed federal investigators had seized years’ worth of email and phone records relating to one of its reporters, Ali Watkins. She previously had a three-year romantic relationship with Wolfe, The Times reported, adding that the records covered a period of time before she joined the paper.FED INDICTMENT JUST RELEASED:CT reports:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]In a just released 11-page federal indictment (full pdf ) a Senior Staff official for the Senate Select Committee Intelligence, James A.

Now, the dots are filled in: “Watkins previously had a three-year romantic relationship with James A. Wolfe, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s former director of security”The relationship with Wolfe was fruitful for Ali Watkins according to Jordan Schachtel:Worth noting that some of these articles viciously smeared Carter Page and seemed particularly weaponized for the purpose of boosting the “Trump-Russia” conspiracy.

This could be a turning point in restoring trust in the FBI.Schachtel posted several examples of Watkins pushing “Trump-Russia”:BREAKING: The DOJ's Senate leak investigation is DIRECTLY RELATED to ""Trump-Russia.""

986,07-Jun-18,"In January of this year, many conservative facebook groups saw a sudden drop in traffic while the left-leaning groups remained the same or even saw a rise in readership. President Trump’s own Facebook page saw a 45% drop in readership! Many conservative publishers have chosen not to fight. This is disturbing! This has raised questions of whether censorship has taken hold of the social media platforms that for so long boasted of being free speech platforms for all opinions.One of the most disturbing developments has been that the platforms are using the Southern Poverty Law Center to decide what hate speech policies to implement. A perfect example of the history of bias by this group was just in the new:Christian legal groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom — which recently successfully represented a Christian baker at the Supreme Court — are barred from the Amazon Smile program, while openly anti-Semitic groups remain…THIS IS SHOCKING INFORMATION FROM THE DAILY CALLER:Daily Caller reports:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Four of the world’s biggest tech platforms have working partnerships with a left-wing nonprofit that has a track record of inaccuracies and routinely labels conservative organizations as “hate groups.”Facebook, Amazon, Google and Twitter all work with or consult the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in policing their platforms for “hate speech” or “hate groups,” a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation found.The SPLC is on a list of “external experts and organizations” that Facebook works with “to inform our hate speech policies,” Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhraja told TheDCNF in an interview.Facebook consults the outside organizations when developing changes to hate speech policies, Budhraja said, noting that Facebook representatives will typically hold between one and three meetings with the groups.Citing privacy concerns, the Facebook spokeswoman declined to name all the outside groups working with Facebook, but confirmed the SPLC’s participation.Budhraja emphasized that Facebook’s definition of “hate group” is distinct from the SPLC’s definition and said that Facebook consults with groups across the political spectrum.The SPLC accused Facebook in a May 8 article of not doing enough to censor “anti-Muslim hate” on the platform. That article did not disclose the SPLC’s working partnership with Facebook.“We have our own process and our processes are different and I think that’s why we get the criticism [from the SPLC], because organizations that are hate organizations by their standards don’t match ours,” Budhraja said.“That doesn’t mean that we don’t have a process in place, and that definitely doesn’t mean we want the platform to be a place for hate but we aren’t going to map to the SPLC’s list or process,” she said.Of the four companies, Amazon gives the SPLC the most direct authority over its platform, TheDCNF found.While Facebook emphasizes its independence from the SPLC, Amazon does the opposite: Jeff Bezos’ company grants the SPLC broad policing power over the Amazon Smile charitable program, while claiming to remain unbiased.“We remove organizations that the SPLC deems as ineligible,” an Amazon spokeswoman told TheDCNF.Amazon grants the SPLC that power “because we don’t want to be biased whatsoever,” said the spokeswoman, who could not say whether Amazon considers the SPLC to be unbiased.The Smile program allows customers to identify a charity to receive 0.5 percent of the proceeds from their purchases on Amazon. Customers have given more than $8 million to charities through the program since 2013, according to Amazon.Christian legal groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom — which recently successfully represented a Christian baker at the Supreme Court — are barred from the Amazon Smile program, while openly anti-Semitic groups remain, TheDCNF found in May.Only one participant in the program, the SPLC, gets to determine which other groups are allowed to join it.One month later, the anti-Semitic groups — but not the Alliance Defending Freedom — are still able to participate in the program.Twitter lists the SPLC as a “safety partner” working with Twitter to combat “hateful conduct and harassment.”The platform also includes the Trust and Safety Council, which “provides input on our safety products, policies, and programs,” according to Twitter.

He really understood, and I am very hopeful that this will turn out really positively.”Kardashian West initially became involved in Johnson’s case in October when she saw a Mic Opinion video featuring Johnson sharing her story from prison.“I saw your video,” Kardashian West told Mic. “If you think about a decision that you’ve made in your life and you get life without the possibility of parole for your first-time nonviolent offense, there’s just something so wrong with that.”After tweeting that video, Kardashian West enlisted her personal attorney Shawn Chapman Holley to provide legal support for Johnson’s clemency petition.

Kardashian West and Kushner’s phone conversations about Johnson picked up in recent weeks, which prompted Kushner to bring Johnson’s file in front of White House attorneys, and then Trump, about a potential release.Now Johnson will be released from prison just after celebrating her 63rd birthday and after more than 21 years behind bars.Johnson was convicted for her role facilitating communications in a cocaine trafficking operation in Memphis, Tennessee.

Kardashian also tweeted that Johnson’s commutation is “inspirational” and “gives hope to so many others who are also deserving of a second chance.”So grateful to @realDonaldTrump, Jared Kushner & to everyone who has showed compassion & contributed countless hours to this important moment for Ms. Alice Marie Johnson.

The Obama administration turned around and granted a license to let Iran have access to the U.S. financial system!Is it any wonder that John Kerry (see our report below) has been slamming President Trump just like the other corrupt people who were in the Obama administration? These people are guilty of betraying the American people! The report really opens the pandora’s box between Iran and what went on with the Obama administration to pass BILLIONS to Iran…BILLIONS!The Weekly Standard reports:Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The 53-page report by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), chaired by Ohio senator Rob Portman, also reveals the extent of Obama administration efforts to encourage foreign countries to do business with Iran. Its release comes after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the agreement and reimposing nuclear deal-related sanctions on Iran.The lifting of those sanctions in January 2016 allowed Tehran to tap into its previously frozen assets abroad, including $5.7 billion rials held in an Omani bank, Bank Muscat. Iran wanted to convert those funds to euros, which could be done most efficiently by first converting to U.S. dollars as an “intermediary step.” In an effort to allow Iran to convert its once-frozen rials, the Treasury Department granted a specific license in February 2016 that authorized the Iranian assets to be converted using the U.S. financial system, according to the report.“A conversion to U.S. dollars on behalf of the [Central Bank of Iran] was prohibited under U.S. sanctions,” the report says. “Other options existed to convert the funds from rials to euros without using the U.S. financial system. But using the U.S. dollar as an intermediary step was the most efficient means, even though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.”We all know what happened next…“ROADSHOWS”???Wednesday’s report also detailed efforts by Obama administration officials to drum up business for Iran, including over 200 “roadshows” abroad meant to encourage various countries to engage with Tehran. During one such trip, the report says, one U.S. official signaled that the administration would not stringently punish every sanctions violation.Read more: The Weekly StandardIT DOESN’T END THERE:President Barack Obama and his administration ALSO disbanded national security units which were originally charged with investigating Iran’s network of Islamic terrorism funding.Obama, Valerie Jarrett (born in Iran), Susan Rice and other members of the former President’s inner-circle “systematically disbanded” special law enforcement units throughout the federal government that were investigating the Iranian, Syrian, and Venezuelan terrorism financing networks. Obama and his Secretary of State John Kerry were concerned the counter-terrorism units would lead to Iranian officials walking away from Obama’s precious nuclear deal with Iran, according to a former U.S. official with expertise in dismantling criminal financial networks. https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/blog/6-takeaways-yesterdays-hearing-hezbollah/Documents were requested last May relating to the Iran Deal in a letter from Rep. Jason Chaffetz:In part, the letter stated: When President Obama revealed a prisoner exchange agreement with Iran in January 2016, he announced the release of one Iranian and six Iranian-Americans convicted of crimes or awaiting trial. The President described the exchange as a benign “reciprocal humanitarian gesture,” and went as far as to call the individuals released “civilians” who “were not charged with terrorism or any violent offenses.” Among those granted clemency were individuals that the Justice Department deemed threats to national security. The news account identified 14 Iranian fugitives accused of serious crimes for whom the Obama Administration dropped criminal charges, but never released the names or charges. These reports note an Iranian spokesperson contradicted the Administration’s position by claiming there were 28 Iranians “freed or relieved from judicial restrictions” as part of the prisoner exchange agreement. If true, this leaves seven individuals unaccounted for. [It was] also reported that Obama Administration officials blocked and delayed law enforcement efforts to lure Iranian fugitives to countries where they could be arrested and to extradite Iranian suspects in custody overseas.

997,04-Jun-18,"A Metropolitan police report released last month indicated that between 2014 and 2016 the number of children carrying knives in London schools rose by almost 50%, while the number of knife offences in London schools rose by 26%. The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, called it a “wake-up call”.In October, the Sentencing Council published draft guidelines for stiffer sentences for people carrying knives. Chief Constable Alf Hitchcock, who leads the National Police Chiefs Council taskforce on knife crime, told the London Evening Standard in early March that the “peak age” for carrying knives is “getting younger”, and is currently between 13 and 17. “You’ve got a group of people probably being influenced by their siblings, by their peer group, and carrying, which is not a good trend,” he said. In Manchester, parents of a 14-year-old were ordered to pay £1,000 to a boy their son stabbed several times outside school. During a month-long amnesty in Surrey, police collected 237 knives, which will be used, along with knives collected by police across the country, in a 27ft sculpture called Knife Angel, which may yet adorn the empty fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square.When politicians and officials seek to pre-empt public indignation by making statements about wake-up calls and warning lights, it is a sign that something unacceptable is unfolding, which they lack either the will or the ability to address.The answer to Fola’s mother’s question – “How many more of our children have to die before the government act?” – is both damning and complex. Many more children will die from knife-related violence; indeed, four more have been stabbed to death since she posed it. But it is not because the government and related agencies are not acting. Pretty much every week, somewhere in the country, there is some kind of initiative to tackle “knife crime”’ – an amnesty, a new charity in the name of the fallen, an appeal from police, a mayoral statement. –The GuardianThe Telegraph is reporting that a judge has proposed a nationwide program to file down the points of kitchen knives as a solution to the country’s soaring knife crime epidemic.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Last week in his valedictory address, retiring Luton Crown Court Judge Nic Madge spoke of his concern that carrying a knife had become routine in some circles and called on the Government to ban the sale of large pointed kitchen knives.Latest figures show stabbing deaths among teenagers and young adults have reached the highest level for eight years, and knife crime overall rose 22 percent in 2017.In the past two months, he said, there have been 77 knife-related incidents in Bedfordshire, including three killings.Judge Madge told the assembled  judges, barristers, and court staff: “These offenses often seem motiveless – one boy was stabbed because he had an argument a couple of years before at his junior school.”He said laws designed to reduce the availability of weapons to young would-be offenders had had “almost no effect”, since the vast majority had merely taken knives from a cutlery drawer.He said: “A few of the blades carried by youths are so-called ‘Rambo knives’ or samurai swords. They though are a very small minority.“The reason why these measures have little effect is that the vast majority of knives carried by youths are ordinary kitchen knives. Every kitchen contains lethal knives which are potential murder weapons.“Accordingly, it is very easy for any youth who wants to obtain a knife to take it from the kitchen drawer in his home or in the home of one of his friends.”As a result – said the judge – the most common knife a youth will take out is eight to ten inches, long and pointed, from his mother’s cutlery tray.He asked: “But why we do need eight-inch or ten-inch kitchen knives with points?“Butchers and fishmongers do, but how often, if at all, does a domestic chef use the point of an eight-inch or ten-inch knife? Rarely, if at all.”“Acknowledging that any blade could cause injury, the judge pointed out “slash wounds are rarely fatal.”So, he said: “I would urge all those with any role in relation to knives – manufacturers, shops, the police, local authorities, the government – to consider preventing the sale of long pointed knives, except in rare, defined, circumstances, and replacing such knives with rounded ends.“It might even be that the police could organize a programme whereby the owners of kitchen knives, which have been properly and lawfully bought for culinary purposes, could be taken somewhere to be modified, with the points being ground down into rounded ends,” he said.The judge is likely envisioning a scenario that would look like this: UK Government: “Knock…knock”Criminal: “Who’s there”UK Government: “The government. We’re here to dull the blades on your knives and round the tips, so you can’t stab anyone with them.”Criminal: “No problem, I’ll be right there with all of my knives. I appreciate you stopping by to help put an end to the violence.”LOL…",fake

1001,02-Jun-18,"Dan Bongino drops a huge new piece of information on when the spying started on the Trump campaign. The FBI is hiding paragraph one…The FBI refuses to tell what paragraph one is…WHY?Bongino says we’re focusing on “the pull”….The real question is how was the email information about the Russian dirt fed to the campaign?  It was fed to the campaign by a professor who has now disappeared:Painting a full picture of Mifsud is difficult because after the 58-year-old professor was first identified by name in a Washington Post article in the weeks following Papadopoulos’ confession, he gave a few interviews to the international press, and then disappeared.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Real Clear Politics reports:In the shifting narratives of the Trump-Russia probe, a Maltese academic named Joseph Mifsud has remained a linchpin regarding claims of collusion. He is the professor who allegedly told Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos that the Russians had emails related to the Clinton campaign. The FBI says it opened its investigation in late July 2016 after Papadopoulos relayed that information to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, and the Australians tipped off U.S. authorities.While some news accounts describe Mifsud as an accomplice to Russian clandestine operations or a “cut-out” (intermediary), others contend he is a full-fledged Russian spy.In an official report, Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence asserted that “in their approach to Papadopoulos, the Russians used common tradecraft and employed a cut-out,” a “Kremlin-linked…Maltese professor named Joseph Mifsud.”No one in the American intelligence community has publicly challenged this description.But there is one major problem with this story: No evidence has been presented to support the claim. Although Mifsud has traveled many times to Russia and has contacts with Russian academics, his closest public ties are to Western governments, politicians, and institutions, including the CIA, FBI and British intelligence services. One of Mifsud’s jobs has been to train diplomats, police officers, and intelligence officers at schools in London and Rome, where he lived and worked over the last dozen years. The house-of-mirrors nature of the claim that Mifsud is a spy is reflected in the guilty plea Papadopoulos signed on Oct. 5, 2017 for making several material false statements to the FBI. It reads, in part: “Defendant PAPADOPOULOS further told the investigating agents that the professor was ‘a nothing’ and ‘just a guy talk[ing] up connections or something.’ In truth and in fact, however, defendant PAPADOPOULOS understood that the professor had substantial connections to Russian government officials (and had met with some of those officials in Moscow immediately prior to telling defendant PAPADOPOULOS about the ‘thousands of emails’) and, over a period of months, defendant PAPADOPOULOS repeatedly sought to use the professor’s Russian connections in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials.”If Mifsud truly is a Russian agent – which is key to the collusion narrative – he could prove to be one of the most promiscuous spies in modern history. Western intelligence agencies and European politicians would have to spend the next few decades repairing the damage he did to global security by infiltrating key institutions and personnel. As of yet, however, there is no indication that any intelligence service has begun the embarrassing, but highly important, assessment of how it was penetrated and how it can re-fortify the vulnerabilities that Mifsud may have exposed. There has been no public effort to arrest him.",fake
1002,01-Jun-18,"A new sign at a longstanding Philly watering hole has some of the neighborhood’s newcomers outraged.It’s a sign that would’ve stopped Michelle Obama dead in her tracks, unless, of course, her husband was President of the United States…About 15 minutes into my Thursday-night visit to Old Philadelphia Bar, the inevitable happened. A man, who said he was a former firefighter before saying that he was a Mexican, which he then said was “just a joke” (the Mexican part), walked up to the jukebox, put his money inside, and played the 1984 Lee Greenwood hit “God Bless the USA.” And as the anthemic chorus began, many of the patriotic patrons at the bar joined in:And I’m proud to be an American
Where at least I know I’m free
And I won’t forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I’d gladly stand up next to you
And defend Her still today
’Cause there ain’t no doubt
I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.It’s a fitting theme song for the smoky little bar at the corner of Martha and Dauphin streets in the Kensington section of Philadelphia — just around the corner from popular spots like Pizza Brain and Martha, and just across the border from Fishtown. The sign on the front door reads: “IF YOU’RE NOT PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN, DO NOT BOTHER TO COME IN.”Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]The sign doesn’t say “If you’re not an American, do not bother to come in” it simply states that if you’re not “proud” to be America, do not bother to come in.Earlier this week, a passerby took notice of the door signage and posted it to a Facebook community group, where outrage ensued. One person joked that the bar must belong to Joey Vento, the late owner of Geno’s Steaks, who infamously and proudly displayed that “THIS IS AMERICA … SPEAK ENGLISH” sign at the iconic cheesesteak shop.One young Fairmount woman who saw the image said she’d be sure to skip Old Philadelphia Bar — the locals simply call it Old Philly — because her boyfriend is an Indian man who has a beard.“I would avoid going there,” she told me. “It’s usually fine. Sometimes, some places, it’s not fine. As is obvious from that sign.”But the staff and regulars inside Old Philadelphia Bar don’t understand what all the fuss is about, and a bar manager told Philly Mag that, if anything, the addition of the sign has increased business.“If you’re in this country, you should be proud to be an American,” one Old Philadelphia bartender told me.“But what about people who are in this country who simply aren’t American?” I asked her. “How should they feel about a sign like that?”She shrugged and said, “We love everybody here … Besides, a Spanish guy put it up for us.”Some local residents are reportedly considering filing a complaint about the Old Philadelphia sign with the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, the city’s civil rights agency. Of course, a complaint filed with the PCHR over the Geno’s sign resulted in a ruling that the sign was not discriminatory, and it remained displayed at Geno’s Steaks until 2016, five years after Joey Vento’s death. –Philly Mag ",fake

1004,01-Jun-18,"Remember when Oprah was caught on video explaining to BBC host Will Gompertz that white people “just have to die” to fix racism? Yeah…she said that. Oprah’s not a comedian. In fact, many (myself included) credit Oprah for eight of the most racially charged years since the civil rights era, when she traded in her “America’s darling talk show host” hat for a giant race card. With no knowledge of Barack Obama’s history and very little experience in the real world, outside of his career as a radical community organizer, Oprah pushed Barack Obama for president on her viewers, like her own life depended on it. Why was Oprah so passionate about Barack Obama? Was it his abysmal track record of accomplishment as a Jr. Senator in her home state of Illinois? Was it his vote to support the killing babies who were fortunate enough to survive abortions? Or was it simply because he was black? No one dared to question her motives, simply because she was Oprah and she was standing on the left side of the aisle…she was firmly aligned with Democrat Party the Party of the untouchables.It’s interesting that Hollywood is cheering the demise of Roseanne over her “racist” tweet, that cost her and her fellow actors dearly, when ABC announced they were pulling the plug on her wildly successful reboot of  the “Roseanne Show”,  when you could’ve heard a pin drop in the deafening silence from the media and her Hollywood peers, that followed Oprah’s disgusting, racist comment during her interview with BBC.Oprah made a very good living by playing on the emotions of a 77% white female audience. Approximately 5.9 million white women watched the Oprah Winfrey Show every day, as compared to 1.4 million black women. A lot has changed since the days of the Oprah Winfrey Show, however. For eight long years, we watched a President and First Lady, who Oprah helped to put into the White House, shame white Americans for their “privilege” and for consciously or subconsciously having racist thoughts and tendencies. We watched cities burn, while President Obama and his race-baiter friend, and frequent visitor to the White House, Al Sharpton fanned the flames. Even after the witnesses admitted during their Grand Jury testimony, that Brown’s hands were not “up” when he was shot, well-known black leaders and celebrities like Oprah and Beyonce remained silent about the innocence of Officer Wilson.While Oprah was in the UK promoting her new film, “The Butler”, in which she plays Gloria Gaines, wife of a White House butler, she spoke to BBC’s Will Gompertz about racism.Oprah told BBC’s Gompertz that there was a whole generation of racist people who were “born and bred and marinated” in racism and that the only way that would change is that they “just have to die”.Trending: KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: “Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom” [VIDEO]Gregory Kane of the Washington Examiner dissected the one-way racism that Oprah pushed during her BBC interview: Ah, the tenets of Libthink, one of which is that anyone opposed to the policies of one President Obama is, by definition, a racist.A second is that only whites can be racist. Another is that no black person, anywhere, at any time and under any circumstances, can be a racist.When the BBC correspondent asked Oprah if she felt that racism was the reason some Americans opposed Obama and his policies. Oprah, the one person responsible, more than any other, for Obama being president, of course, said yes.But she said much more than that. Specifically, she said this when asked if the problem of racism in America had been solved:“Of course the problem [of racism] is not solved. … As long as there are people who still— there’s a whole generation — I say this, you know, I said this, you know, for apartheid, South Africa, I said this for my own, you know, for my own community in the South — there are still generations of people, older people, who were born and bred and marinated in it, in that prejudice and racism, and they just have to die.”In one quick, thoughtless breath, Oprah added another tenet to Libthink: Not only are all racists white, but they also need to “just die,” every last one of them.Once all those old, white racists “who were born and bred and marinated in it” have died, then America will be forever purged of racism.Make that “white racism,” and remember, according to Libthink doctrine, that’s the only racism worth mentioning.",fake
1005,31-May-18,"After Barack Obama won the 2008 presidential election, Blagojevich was caught attempting to sell Obama’s U.S. Senate seat. Obama was about to help him sell his seat when he learned that federal investigators were wire-tapping him.Trump called the former governor’s sentence on corruption charges  “really unfair” and added that “plenty of other politicians could have said a lot worse.”The former Democratic governor, who was a contestant on Trump’s “Celebrity Apprentice” in 2010, began his 14-year prison sentence in 2012 after being convicted of corruption. Blagovich’s scheduled release date is in 2024.Trump suggested he was more interested in “curtailing his sentence” than a full pardon. – Fox NewsIn June, 2010, Illinois union leader, Thomas Balanoff, testified that he received a phone call the day before the election from President Obama to discuss Valerie Jarrett and the Senate seat.

Rod Blagojevich’s criminal investigation.The organization is seeking FBI reports of interviews, known as “302s,” of President Obama, Valerie Jarrett, and Rahm Emanuel.“The FBI interviewed Barack Obama eight years ago about the selling of his Senate seat. The American people should finally get to see these FBI interview reports,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The public has a right to know precisely how Obama and his senior White House advisors Emanuel and Jarrett responded to Blagojevich’s corrupt attempts sell Obama’s Senate seat.”The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.After the 2008 election, Blagojevich attempted to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by then President-elect Obama.Blagojevich approached the president-elect as well as supporters of Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr.Obama declined to make a deal, and he was about to make a deal with Rep. Jackson’s supporters for $1.5 million in exchange for offering the U.S. Senate seat when he learned federal investigators were wiretapping him.After two criminal trials in 2010 and 2011, Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in jail for 18 separate charges.Judicial Watch asked the FBI through FOIA to produce the 302s in June 2011.The FBI confirmed that the records existed, but denied the request in 2012 because the criminal case was ongoing.In May 2016, Judicial Watch sued for the records for the first time after the Supreme Court refused to review Blagojevich’s convictions.The organization closed the lawsuit while Blagojevich was being re-sentenced and re-filed it after he was re-sentenced.The lawsuit says the records could not be said to “reasonably interfere” with the former governor’s prosecution as he pursues an appeal of his sentence.In the final hours of his presidency, Obama commuted the sentences of 330 federal inmates convicted of drug crimes but left Blagojevich, who is serving a 14-year federal sentence for public corruption, off the list.“Not on the list of 330 that was released today,” Patti Blagojevich wrote on her Facebook page later in the day. “Don’t know if he is done yet.

During her slide-show presentation, she explained how the Obama campaign extracted Facebook user’s personal information.Davidsen explained how they used the “Optimizer” and “Narwhal”, “A large data set with an API on top of it”. Davidsen explained, “When things can go crazy, is when you actually give people the data and you don’t really realize what is going on.”Davidson asked her audience, “Who owns” your information?” Davidsen continued to explain how, with the help of Facebook, the Obama 2012 campaign was able to extract the personal information of most of the people on Facebook.“Facebook, 2012 election, had the ability for people to “opt-in”.

So, the data’s out there. You can’t take it back, right? So the Democrats have this information. So, when they look at a voter file, and someone comes to them, they can immediately be like, ‘Oh, here are all of the other people that they know, and here are the people that they can help us persuade because they’re really good friends with this person.’ The Republicans do not have this information, and will not get that information.”Davidsen confessed, ” I’m a Democrat, so you know, maybe I could argue that maybe that’s a good thing.
